@cindex Introduction

AutoGen is a tool designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.  Its goal is to simplify the
maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
This is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text
that must be kept synchronized in parallel tables.

One common example is the problem of maintaining the code required for
processing program options.  Processing options requires a minimum of
four different constructs be kept in proper order in different places in
your program.  You need at least:

@enumerate
@item
The flag character in the flag string,
@item
code to process the flag when it is encountered,
@item
a global state variable or two, and
@item
a line in the usage text.
@end enumerate

@noindent
You will need more things besides this if you choose to implement long
option names, rc/ini/config file processing, environment variables and so on.
All of this can be done mechanically; with the proper templates and this
program.  In fact, it has already been done and AutoGen itself uses it@:
@xref{AutoOpts}.  For a simple example of Automated Option processing,
@xref{Quick Start}.  For a full list of the Automated Option features,
@xref{Features}.

@node Generalities
@section The Purpose of AutoGen

The idea of this program is to have a text file, a template if
you will, that contains the general text of the desired output file.
That file includes substitution expressions and sections of text that are
replicated under the control of separate definition files.

@cindex design goals

AutoGen was designed with the following features:

@enumerate
@item
The definitions are completely separate from the template.  By completely
isolating the definitions from the template it greatly increases the
flexibility of the template implementation.  A secondary goal is that a
template user only needs to specify those data that are necessary to describe
his application of a template.

@item
Each datum in the definitions is named.  Thus, the definitions can be
rearranged, augmented and become obsolete without it being necessary to
go back and clean up older definition files.  Reduce incompatibilities!

@item
Every definition name defines an array of values, even when there is
only one entry.  These arrays of values are used to control the
replication of sections of the template.

@item
There are named collections of definitions.  They form a nested hierarchy.
Associated values are collected and associated with a group name.
These associated data are used collectively in sets of substitutions.

@item
The template has special markers to indicate where substitutions are
required, much like the @code{$@{VAR@}} construct in a shell @code{here doc}.
These markers are not fixed strings.  They are specified at the start of
each template.  Template designers know best what fits into their
syntax and can avoid marker conflicts.

We did this because it is burdensome and difficult to avoid conflicts
using either M4 tokenization or C preprocessor substitution rules.  It
also makes it easier to specify expressions that transform the value.
Of course, our expressions are less cryptic than the shell methods.

@item
These same markers are used, in conjunction with enclosed keywords, to
indicate sections of text that are to be skipped and for sections of
text that are to be repeated.  This is a major improvement over using C
preprocessing macros.  With the C preprocessor, you have no way of
selecting output text because it is an @i{un}varying, mechanical
substitution process.

@item
Finally, we supply methods for carefully controlling the output.
Sometimes, it is just simply easier and clearer to compute some text or
a value in one context when its application needs to be later.  So,
functions are available for saving text or values for later use.
@end enumerate

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Example Usage
@section A Simple Example
@cindex example, simple AutoGen

This is just one simple example that shows a few basic features.
If you are interested, you also may run "make check" with the
@code{VERBOSE} environment variable set and see a number of other
examples in the @file{agen5/test/testdir} directory.

Assume you have an enumeration of names and you wish to associate some
string with each name.  Assume also, for the sake of this example,
that it is either too complex or too large to maintain easily by hand.
We will start by writing an abbreviated version of what the result
is supposed to be.  We will use that to construct our output templates.

@noindent
In a header file, @file{list.h}, you define the enumeration
and the global array containing the associated strings:

@example
typedef enum @{
        IDX_ALPHA,
        IDX_BETA,
        IDX_OMEGA @}  list_enum;

extern char const* az_name_list[ 3 ];
@end example

@noindent
Then you also have @file{list.c} that defines the actual strings:

@example
#include "list.h"
char const* az_name_list[] = @{
        "some alpha stuff",
        "more beta stuff",
        "final omega stuff" @};
@end example

@noindent
First, we will define the information that is unique for each enumeration
name/string pair.  This would be placed in a file named, @file{list.def},
for example.

@example
autogen definitions list;
list = @{ list_element = alpha;
         list_info    = "some alpha stuff"; @};
list = @{ list_info    = "more beta stuff";
         list_element = beta; @};
list = @{ list_element = omega;
         list_info    = "final omega stuff"; @};
@end example

The @code{autogen definitions list;} entry defines the file as an AutoGen
definition file that uses a template named @code{list}.  That is followed by
three @code{list} entries that define the associations between the
enumeration names and the strings.  The order of the differently named
elements inside of list is unimportant.  They are reversed inside of the
@code{beta} entry and the output is unaffected.

Now, to actually create the output, we need a template or two that can be
expanded into the files you want.  In this program, we use a single template
that is capable of multiple output files.  The definitions above refer to a
@file{list} template, so it would normally be named, @file{list.tpl}.

It looks something like this.
(For a full description, @xref{Template File}.)

@example
[+ AutoGen5 template h c +]
[+ CASE (suffix) +][+
   ==  h  +]
typedef enum @{[+
   FOR list "," +]
        IDX_[+ (string-upcase! (get "list_element")) +][+
   ENDFOR list +] @}  list_enum;

extern char const* az_name_list[ [+ (count "list") +] ];
[+

   ==  c  +]
#include "list.h"
char const* az_name_list[] = @{[+
  FOR list "," +]
        "[+list_info+]"[+
  ENDFOR list +] @};[+

ESAC +]
@end example

The @code{[+ AutoGen5 template h c +]} text tells AutoGen that this is
an AutoGen version 5 template file; that it is to be processed twice;
that the start macro marker is @code{[+}; and the end marker is
@code{+]}.  The template will be processed first with a suffix value of
@code{h} and then with @code{c}.  Normally, the suffix values are
appended to the @file{base-name} to create the output file name.

The @code{[+ == h +]} and @code{[+ == c +]} @code{CASE} selection clauses
select different text for the two different passes.  In this example,
the output is nearly disjoint and could have been put in two separate
templates.  However, sometimes there are common sections and this is
just an example.

The @code{[+FOR list "," +]} and @code{[+ ENDFOR list +]} clauses delimit
a block of text that will be repeated for every definition of @code{list}.
Inside of that block, the definition name-value pairs that
are members of each @code{list} are available for substitutions.

The remainder of the macros are expressions.  Some of these contain
special expression functions that are dependent on AutoGen named values;
others are simply Scheme expressions, the result of which will be
inserted into the output text.  Other expressions are names of AutoGen
values.  These values will be inserted into the output text.  For example,
@code{[+list_info+]} will result in the value associated with
the name @code{list_info} being inserted between the double quotes and
@code{(string-upcase! (get "list_element"))} will first "get" the value
associated with the name @code{list_element}, then change the case of
all the letters to upper case.  The result will be inserted into the
output document.

If you have compiled AutoGen, you can copy out the template and definitions
as described above and run @code{autogen list.def}.  This will produce
exactly the hypothesized desired output.

One more point, too.  Lets say you decided it was too much trouble to figure
out how to use AutoGen, so you created this enumeration and string list with
thousands of entries.  Now, requirements have changed and it has become
necessary to map a string containing the enumeration name into the enumeration
number.  With AutoGen, you just alter the template to emit the table of names.
It will be guaranteed to be in the correct order, missing none of the entries.
If you want to do that by hand, well, good luck.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node csh/zsh caveat
@section csh/zsh caveat

AutoGen tries to use your normal shell so that you can supply shell code
in a manner you are accustomed to using.  If, however, you use csh or
zsh, you cannot do this.  Csh is sufficiently difficult to program that
it is unsupported.  Zsh, though largely programmable, also has some
anomalies that make it incompatible with AutoGen usage.  Therefore, when
invoking AutoGen from these environments, you must be certain to set the
SHELL environment variable to a Bourne-derived shell, e.g., sh, ksh or
bash.

Any shell you choose for your own scripts need to follow these basic
requirements:

@enumerate
@item
It handles @code{trap $sig ":"} without output to standard out.
This is done when the server shell is first started.
If your shell does not handle this, then it may be able to by
loading functions from its start up files.
@item
At the beginning of each scriptlet, the command @code{\\cd $PWD}
is inserted.  This ensures that @code{cd} is not aliased to something
peculiar and each scriptlet starts life in the execution directory.
@item
At the end of each scriptlet, the command @code{echo mumble} is
appended.  The program you use as a shell must emit the single
argument @code{mumble} on a line by itself.
@end enumerate

@section A User's Perspective

@end format

I am using AutoGen in my pet project, and find one of its best points to
be that it separates the operational data from the implementation.

Indulge me for a few paragraphs, and all will be revealed:
In the manual, Bruce cites the example of maintaining command line flags
inside the source code; traditionally spreading usage information, flag
names, letters and processing across several functions (if not files).
Investing the time in writing a sort of boiler plate (a template in
AutoGen terminology) pays by moving all of the option details (usage,
flags names etc.) into a well structured table (a definition file if you
will),  so that adding a new command line option becomes a simple matter
of adding a set of details to the table.

So far so good!  Of course, now that there is a template, writing all of
that tedious optargs processing and usage functions is no longer an
issue.  Creating a table of the options needed for the new project and
running AutoGen generates all of the option processing code in C
automatically from just the tabular data.  AutoGen in fact already ships
with such a template... AutoOpts.

One final consequence of the good separation in the design of AutoGen is
that it is retargetable to a greater extent.  The
egcs/gcc/fixinc/inclhack.def can equally be used (with different
templates) to create a shell script (inclhack.sh) or a c program
(fixincl.c).

This is just the tip of the iceberg.  AutoGen is far more powerful than
these examples might indicate, and has many other varied uses.  I am
certain Bruce or I could supply you with many and varied examples, and I
would heartily recommend that you try it for your project and see for
yourself how it compares to m4.
@cindex m4

As an aside, I would be interested to see whether someone might be
persuaded to rationalise autoconf with AutoGen in place of m4...  Ben,
are you listening?  autoconf-3.0! `kay?  =)O|

@node Definitions File
@chapter Definitions File
@cindex definitions file
@cindex .def file

This chapter describes the syntax and semantics of the AutoGen
definition file.  In order to instantiate a template, you normally must
provide a definitions file that identifies itself and contains some
value definitions.  Consequently, we keep it very simple.  For
"advanced" users, there are preprocessing directives, sparse
arrays, named indexes and comments that may be used as well.

The definitions file is used to associate values with names.  Every
value is implicitly an array of values, even if there is only one value.
Values may be either simple strings or compound collections of
name-value pairs.  An array may not contain both simple and compound
members.  Fundamentally, it is as simple as:

@example
prog-name = "autogen";
flag = @{
    name      = templ_dirs;
    value     = L;
    descrip   = "Template search directory list";
@};
@end example

For purposes of commenting and controlling the processing of the
definitions, C-style comments and most C preprocessing directives are
honored.  The major exception is that the @code{#if} directive is
ignored, along with all following text through the matching
@code{#endif} directive.  The C preprocessor is not actually invoked, so
C macro substitution is @strong{not} performed.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Identification
@section The Identification Definition
@cindex identification

The first definition in this file is used to identify it as a
AutoGen file.  It consists of the two keywords,
@samp{autogen} and @samp{definitions} followed by the default
template name and a terminating semi-colon (@code{;}).  That is:

@example
        AutoGen Definitions @var{template-name};
@end example

@noindent
Note that, other than the name @var{template-name}, the words
@samp{AutoGen} and @samp{Definitions} are searched for without case
sensitivity.  Most lookups in this program are case insensitive.

@noindent
Also, if the input contains more identification definitions,
they will be ignored.  This is done so that you may include
(@pxref{Directives}) other definition files without an identification
conflict.

@cindex template file

@noindent
AutoGen uses the name of the template to find the corresponding template
file.  It searches for the file in the following way, stopping when
it finds the file:

@enumerate
@item
It tries to open @file{./@var{template-name}}.  If it fails,
@item
it tries @file{./@var{template-name}.tpl}.
@item
It searches for either of these files in the directories listed in the
templ-dirs command line option.
@end enumerate

If AutoGen fails to find the template file in one of these places,
it prints an error message and exits.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Definitions
@section Named Definitions
@cindex definitions

Any name may have multiple values associated with it in the definition
file.  If there is more than one instance, the @strong{only} way to
expand all of the copies of it is by using the FOR (@pxref{FOR}) text
function on it, as described in the next chapter.

There are two kinds of definitions, @samp{simple} and @samp{compound}.
They are defined thus (@pxref{Full Syntax}):

@example
compound_name '=' '@{' definition-list '@}' ';'

simple_name '=' string ';'

no_text_name ';'
@end example

@noindent
@code{No_text_name} is a simple definition with a shorthand empty string
value.  The string values for definitions may be specified in any of
several formation rules.

@cindex simple definitions
@cindex compound definitions

@node def-list
@subsection Definition List

@code{definition-list} is a list of definitions that may or may not
contain nested compound definitions.  Any such definitions may
@strong{only} be expanded within a @code{FOR} block iterating over the
containing compound definition.  @xref{FOR}.

Here is, again, the example definitions from the previous chapter,
with three additional name value pairs.  Two with an empty value
assigned (@var{first} and @var{last}), and a "global" @var{group_name}.

@example
autogen definitions list;
group_name = example;
list = @{ list_element = alpha;  first;
         list_info    = "some alpha stuff"; @};
list = @{ list_info    = "more beta stuff";
         list_element = beta; @};
list = @{ list_element = omega;  last;
         list_info    = "final omega stuff"; @};
@end example

@node double-quote-string
@subsection Double Quote String

@cindex string, double quote
The string follows the C-style escaping (@code{\}, @code{\n}, @code{\f},
@code{\v}, etc.), plus octal character numbers specified as @code{\ooo}.
The difference from "C" is that the string may span multiple lines.
Like ANSI "C", a series of these strings, possibly intermixed with
single quote strings, will be concatenated together.

@node single-quote-string
@subsection Single Quote String

@cindex string, single quote
This is similar to the shell single-quote string.  However, escapes
@code{\} are honored before another escape, single quotes @code{'}
and hash characters @code{#}.  This latter is done specifically
to disambiguate lines starting with a hash character inside
of a quoted string.  In other words,

@example
fumble = '
#endif
';
@end example

could be misinterpreted by the definitions scanner, whereas
this would not:

@example
fumble = '
\#endif
';
@end example

@*
As with the double quote string, a series of these, even intermixed
with double quote strings, will be concatenated together.

@node shell-generated
@subsection Shell Output String
@cindex shell-generated string

@cindex string, shell output
This is assembled according to the same rules as the double quote string,
except that there is no concatenation of strings and the resulting string is
written to a shell server process.  The definition takes on the value of
the output string.

NB@: The text is interpreted by a server shell.  There may be left over
state from previous server shell processing.  This scriptlet may also leave
state for subsequent processing.  However, a @code{cd} to the original
directory is always issued before the new command is issued.

@node simple-string
@subsection An Unquoted String

A simple string that does not contain white space @i{may} be left
unquoted.  The string must not contain any of the characters special to
the definition text (i.e., @code{"}, @code{#}, @code{'}, @code{(},
@code{)}, @code{,}, @code{;}, @code{<}, @code{=}, @code{>}, @code{[},
@code{]}, @code{`}, @code{@{}, or @code{@}}).  This list is subject to
change, but it will never contain underscore (@code{_}), period
(@code{.}), slash (@code{/}), colon (@code{:}), hyphen (@code{-}) or
backslash (@code{\\}).  Basically, if the string looks like it is a
normal DOS or UNIX file or variable name, and it is not one of two
keywords (@samp{autogen} or @samp{definitions}) then it is OK to not
quote it, otherwise you should.

@node scheme-generated
@subsection Scheme Result String

A scheme result string must begin with an open parenthesis @code{(}.
The scheme expression will be evaluated by Guile and the
value will be the result.  The AutoGen expression functions
are @strong{dis}abled at this stage, so do not use them.

@node here-string
@subsection A Here String
@cindex here-string

A @samp{here string} is formed in much the same way as a shell here doc.
It is denoted with two less than characters(@code{<<}) and, optionally, a
hyphen.  This is followed by optional horizontal white space and an
ending marker-identifier.  This marker must follow the syntax rules
for identifiers.  Unlike the shell version, however, you must not quote
this marker.

The resulting string will start with the first character on the next line
and continue up to but not including the newline that precedes the line that
begins with the marker token.  If a hyphen follows the less than characters,
then leading tabs will be stripped and the terminating marker will be
recognized even if preceded by tabs.  No backslash or any other kind of
processing is done on this string.  The characters are copied directly into
the result string.

Here are two examples:
@example
str1 = <<-  STR_END
        $quotes = " ' `
        STR_END;

str2 = <<   STR_END
        $quotes = " ' `
        STR_END;
STR_END;
@end example
The first string contains no new line characters.
The first character is the dollar sign, the last the back quote.

The second string contains one new line character.  The first character
is the tab character preceding the dollar sign.  The last character is
the semicolon after the @code{STR_END}.  That @code{STR_END} does not
end the string because it is not at the beginning of the line.  In the
preceding case, the leading tab was stripped.

@node concat-string
@subsection Concatenated Strings
@cindex concat-string

If single or double quote characters are used,
then you also have the option, a la ANSI-C syntax,
of implicitly concatenating a series of them together,
with intervening white space ignored.

NB@:  You @strong{cannot} use directives to alter the string
content.  That is,

@example
str = "fumble"
#ifdef LATER
      "stumble"
#endif
      ;
@end example

@noindent
will result in a syntax error.  The preprocessing directives are not
carried out by the C preprocessor.  However,

@example
str = '"fumble\n"
#ifdef LATER
"     stumble\n"
#endif
';
@end example

@noindent
@strong{Will} work.  It will enclose the @samp{#ifdef LATER}
and @samp{#endif} in the string.  But it may also wreak
havoc with the definition processing directives.  The hash
characters in the first column should be disambiguated with
an escape @code{\} or join them with previous lines:
@code{"fumble\n#ifdef LATER...}.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Index Assignments
@section Assigning an Index to a Definition
@cindex Definition Index

In AutoGen, every name is implicitly an array of values.
When assigning values, they are usually implicitly
assigned to the next highest slot.  They can also be
specified explicitly:

@example
mumble[9] = stumble;
mumble[0] = grumble;
@end example

@noindent
If, subsequently, you assign a value to @code{mumble} without an
index, its index will be @code{10}, not @code{1}.
If indexes are specified, they must not cause conflicts.

@code{#define}-d names may also be used for index values.
This is equivalent to the above:

@example
#define FIRST 0
#define LAST  9
mumble[LAST]  = stumble;
mumble[FIRST] = grumble;
@end example

All values in a range do @strong{not} have to be filled in.
If you leave gaps, then you will have a sparse array.  This
is fine (@pxref{FOR}).  You have your choice of iterating
over all the defined values, or iterating over a range
of slots.  This:

@example
[+ FOR mumble +][+ ENDFOR +]
@end example

@noindent
iterates over all and only the defined entries, whereas this:

@example
[+ FOR mumble (for-by 1) +][+ ENDFOR +]
@end example

@noindent
will iterate over all 10 "slots".  Your template will
likely have to contain something like this:

@example
[+ IF (exist? (sprintf "mumble[%d]" (for-index))) +]
@end example

@noindent
or else "mumble" will have to be a compound value that,
say, always contains a "grumble" value:

@example
[+ IF (exist? "grumble") +]
@end example

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Dynamic Text
@section Dynamic Text
@cindex Dynamic Definition Text

There are several methods for including dynamic content inside a definitions
file.  Three of them are mentioned above (@ref{shell-generated} and
@pxref{scheme-generated}) in the discussion of string formation rules.
Another method uses the @code{#shell} processing directive.
It will be discussed in the next section (@pxref{Directives}).
Guile/Scheme may also be used to yield to create definitions.

When the Scheme expression is preceded by a backslash and single
quote, then the expression is expected to be an alist of
names and values that will be used to create AutoGen definitions.

@noindent
This method can be be used as follows:

@example
\'( (name  (value-expression))
    (name2 (another-expr))  )
@end example

@noindent
This is entirely equivalent to:

@example
name  = (value-expression);
name2 = (another-expr);
@end example

@noindent
Under the covers, the expression gets handed off to a Guile function
named @code{alist->autogen-def} in an expression that looks like this:

@example
(alist->autogen-def
    ( (name (value-expression))  (name2 (another-expr)) ) )
@end example

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Directives
@section Controlling What Gets Processed
@cindex directives

Definition processing directives can @strong{only} be processed
if the '#' character is the first character on a line.  Also, if you
want a '#' as the first character of a line in one of your string
assignments, you should either escape it by preceding it with a
backslash @samp{\}, or by embedding it in the string as in @code{"\n#"}.

All of the normal C preprocessing directives are recognized, though
several are ignored.  There is also an additional @code{#shell} -
@code{#endshell} pair.  Another minor difference is that AutoGen
directives must have the hash character (@code{#}) in column 1.

The final tweak is that @code{#!} is treated as a comment line.
Using this feature, you can use:  @samp{#! /usr/local/bin/autogen}
as the first line of a definitions file, set the mode to executable
and "run" the definitions file as if it were a direct invocation of
AutoGen.  This was done for its hack value.

The ignored directives are:
@ignore
END   == MAIN == DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT or the surrounding 'ignore's
Extraction from autogen.texi
@end ignore

START == COMMENTS == DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT or the surrounding 'ignore's

@node Predefines
@section Pre-defined Names
@cindex predefines

When AutoGen starts, it tries to determine several names from the
operating environment and put them into environment variables for use in
both @code{#ifdef} tests in the definitions files and in shell scripts
with environment variable tests.  @code{__autogen__} is always defined.
For other names, AutoGen will first try to use the POSIX version of the
@code{sysinfo(2)} system call.  Failing that, it will try for the POSIX
@code{uname(2)} call.  If neither is available, then only
"@code{__autogen__}" will be inserted into the environment.
In all cases, the associated names are converted to lower case, surrounded
by doubled underscores and non-symbol characters are replaced with
underscores.

With Solaris on a sparc platform, @code{sysinfo(2)} is available.
The following strings are used:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{SI_SYSNAME} (e.g., "__sunos__")
@item
@code{SI_HOSTNAME} (e.g., "__ellen__")
@item
@code{SI_ARCHITECTURE} (e.g., "__sparc__")
@item
@code{SI_HW_PROVIDER} (e.g., "__sun_microsystems__")
@item
@code{SI_PLATFORM} (e.g., "__sun_ultra_5_10__")
@item
@code{SI_MACHINE} (e.g., "__sun4u__")
@end itemize

For Linux and other operating systems that only support the
@code{uname(2)} call, AutoGen will use these values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{sysname} (e.g., "__linux__")
@item
@code{machine} (e.g., "__i586__")
@item
@code{nodename} (e.g., "__bach__")
@end itemize

By testing these pre-defines in my definitions, you can select
pieces of the definitions without resorting to writing shell
scripts that parse the output of @code{uname(1)}.  You can also
segregate real C code from autogen definitions by testing for
"@code{__autogen__}".

#ifdef __bach__

@node Alternate Definition
@section Alternate Definition Forms
@cindex Alternate Definition

There are several methods for supplying data values for templates.

@table @samp
@item no definitions
It is entirely possible to write a template that does not depend upon
external definitions.  Such a template would likely have an unvarying
output, but be convenient nonetheless because of an external library
of either AutoGen or Scheme functions, or both.  This can be accommodated
by providing the @code{--override-tpl} and @code{--no-definitions}
options on the command line.  @xref{autogen Invocation}.

@item CGI
AutoGen behaves as a CGI server if the definitions input is from stdin
and the environment variable @code{REQUEST_METHOD} is defined
and set to either "GET" or "POST", @xref{AutoGen CGI}.  Obviously,
all the values are constrained to strings because there is no way
to represent nested values.

@item XML
AutoGen comes with a program named, @code{xml2ag}.  Its output can
either be redirected to a file for later use, or the program can
be used as an AutoGen wrapper.  @xref{xml2ag Invocation}.

The introductory template example (@pxref{Example Usage}) can be rewritten
in XML as follows:

@example
<EXAMPLE  template="list.tpl">
<LIST list_element="alpha"
      list_info="some alpha stuff"/>
<LIST list_info="more beta stuff"
      list_element="beta"/>
<LIST list_element="omega"
      list_info="final omega stuff"/>
</EXAMPLE>
@end example

A more XML-normal form might look like this:
@example
<EXAMPLE  template="list.tpl">
<LIST list_element="alpha">some alpha stuff</LIST>
<LIST list_element="beta" >more beta stuff</LIST>
<LIST list_element="omega">final omega stuff</LIST>
</EXAMPLE>
@end example
@noindent
but you would have to change the template @code{list_info} references
into @code{text} references.

@item standard AutoGen definitions
Of course.  :-)

@node Template File
@chapter Template File
@cindex template file
@cindex .tpl file

The AutoGen template file defines the content of the output text.
It is composed of two parts.  The first part consists of a pseudo
macro invocation and commentary.  It is followed by the template proper.

@cindex pseudo macro
@cindex macro, pseudo
This pseudo macro is special.  It is used to identify the file as a
AutoGen template file, fixing the starting and ending marks for
the macro invocations in the rest of the file, specifying the list
of suffixes to be generated by the template and, optionally, the
shell to use for processing shell commands embedded in the template.

AutoGen-ing a file consists of copying text from the template to the
output file until a start macro marker is found.  The text from the
start marker to the end marker constitutes the macro text.  AutoGen
macros may cause sections of the template to be skipped or processed
several times.  The process continues until the end of the template is
reached.  The process is repeated once for each suffix specified in the
pseudo macro.

This chapter describes the format of the AutoGen template macros
and the usage of the AutoGen native macros.  Users may augment
these by defining their own macros, @xref{DEFINE}.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node pseudo macro
@section Format of the Pseudo Macro
@cindex pseudo macro

The pseudo macro is used to tell AutoGen how to process a template.
It tells autogen:

@enumerate
@item
The start macro marker.  It consists of punctuation characters used to
demarcate the start of a macro.  It may be up to seven characters long and
must be the first non-whitespace characters in the file.

@noindent
It is generally a good idea to use some sort of opening
bracket in the starting macro and closing bracket in the ending
macro  (e.g. @code{@{}, @code{(}, @code{[}, or even @code{<}
in the starting macro).  It helps both visually and with editors
capable of finding a balancing parenthesis.

@item
That start marker must be immediately followed by the identifier strings
"AutoGen5" and then "template", though capitalization is not important.
@end enumerate

@noindent
The next several components may be intermingled:

@enumerate 3
@item
Zero, one or more suffix specifications tell AutoGen how many times to
process the template file.  No suffix specifications mean that it is to
be processed once and that the generated text is to be written to
@file{stdout}.  The current suffix for each pass can be determined with the
@code{(suffix)} scheme function (@pxref{SCM suffix}).

The suffix specification consists of a sequence of POSIX compliant file name
characters and, optionally, an equal sign and a file name formatting
specification.  That specification may be either an ordinary sequence of
file name characters with zero, one or two "%s" formatting sequences in it,
or else it may be a Scheme expression that, when evaluated, produces such a
string.  The Scheme result may not be empty.  The two string arguments
allowed for that string are the base name of the definition file, and the
current suffix (that being the text to the left of the equal sign).  (Note:
"POSIX compliant file name characters" consist of alphanumerics plus the
period (@code{.}), hyphen (@code{-}) and underscore (@code{_}) characters.)

If the suffix begins with one of these three latter characters and
a formatting string is not specified, then that character is presumed to
be the suffix separator.  Otherwise, without a specified format string,
a single period will separate the suffix from the base name in constructing
the output file name.

@item
Comments:  blank lines, lines starting with a hash mark [@code{#}]),
and edit mode comments (text between pairs of @code{-*-} strings).

@item
Some scheme expressions may be inserted in order to make configuration
changes before template processing begins.  ``@code{before template
processing begins}'' means that there is no current output file, no current
suffix and, basically, none of the AutoGen specific functions
(@pxref{AutoGen Functions}) may be invoked.

It is used, for example, to allow the template writer to specify
the shell program that must be used to interpret the shell commands in
the template.  It can have no effect on any shell commands in the
definitions file, as that file will have been processed by the time
the pseudo macro is interpreted.

@example
(setenv "SHELL" "/bin/sh")
@end example

@noindent
This is extremely useful to ensure that the shell used is the one the
template was written to use.  By default, AutoGen determines the shell
to use by user preferences.  Sometimes, that can be the "csh", though.

The scheme expression can also be used to save a pre-existing output
file for later text extraction (@pxref{SCM extract}).

@example
(shellf "mv -f %1$s.c %1$s.sav" (base-name))
@end example
@end enumerate

@noindent
After these must come the end macro marker:

@enumerate 6
@item
The punctuation characters used to demarcate the end of a macro.
Like the start marker, it must consist of seven or fewer punctuation
characters.
@end enumerate

The ending macro marker has a few constraints on its content.  Some of
them are just advisory, though.  There is no special check for advisory
restrictions.

@itemize @bullet
@item
It must not begin with a POSIX file name character (hyphen @code{-},
underscore @code{_} or period @code{.}), the backslash (@code{\}) or
open parenthesis (@code{(}).  These are used to identify a suffix
specification, indicate Scheme code and trim white space.

@item
If it begins with an equal sign, then it
must be separated from any suffix specification by white space.

@item
The closing marker may not begin with an open parenthesis, as that is used
to enclose a scheme expression.

@item
It cannot begin with a backslash, as that is used to indicate white
space trimming after the end macro mark.  If, in the body of the template,
you put the backslash character (@code{\}) before the end macro mark, then
any white space characters after the mark and through the newline character
are trimmed.

@item
It is also helpful to avoid using the comment marker (@code{#}).
It might be seen as a comment within the pseudo macro.

@item
You should avoid using any of the quote characters@:  double,
single or back-quote.  It won't confuse AutoGen, but it might well
confuse you and/or your editor.
@end itemize

As an example, assume we want to use @code{[+} and @code{+]} as the start
and end macro markers, and we wish to produce a @file{.c} and a @file{.h}
file, then the pseudo macro might look something like this:

@example
[+ AutoGen5 template -*- Mode: emacs-mode-of-choice -*-
h=chk-%s.h
c
# make sure we don't use csh:
(setenv "SHELL" "/bin/sh")  +]
@end example

The template proper starts after the pseudo-macro.  The starting
character is either the first non-whitespace character or the first
character after the newline that follows the end macro marker.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node naming values
@section Naming a value
@cindex naming values

When an AutoGen value is specified in a template, it is specified by name.
The name may be a simple name, or a compound name of several components.
Since each named value in AutoGen is implicitly an array of one or more
values, each component may have an index associated with it.

@noindent
It looks like this:

@example
comp-name-1 . comp-name-2 [ 2 ]
@end example

Note that if there are multiple components to a name, each component
name is separated by a dot (@code{.}).  Indexes follow a component name,
enclosed in square brackets (@code{[} and @code{]}).  The index may be
either an integer or an integer-valued define name.  The first component
of the name is searched for in the current definition level.  If not
found, higher levels will be searched until either a value is found,
or there are no more definition levels.  Subsequent components of the
name must be found within the context of the newly-current definition
level.  Also, if the named value is prefixed by a dot (@code{.}), then
the value search is started in the current context only.  No higher
levels are searched.

If someone rewrites this, I'll incorporate it.  :-)

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node expression syntax
@section Macro Expression Syntax
@cindex expression syntax

AutoGen has two types of expressions:  full expressions and basic ones.
A full AutoGen expression can appear by itself, or as the argument
to certain AutoGen built-in macros:  CASE, IF, ELIF, INCLUDE,
INVOKE (explicit invocation, @pxref{INVOKE}), and WHILE.
If it appears by itself, the result is inserted into the output.
If it is an argument to one of these macros, the macro code
will act on it sensibly.

You are constrained to basic expressions only when passing
arguments to user defined macros, @xref{DEFINE}.

The syntax of a full AutoGen expression is:

@example
[[ <apply-code> ] <value-name> ] [ <basic-expr-1> [ <basic-expr-2> ]]
@end example

How the expression is evaluated depends upon the presence or absence
of the apply code and value name.  The "value name" is the name of
an AutoGen defined value, or not.  If it does not name such a value,
the expression result is generally the empty string.  All expressions
must contain either a @code{value-name} or a @code{basic-expr}.

@menu
* apply code::           Apply Code
* basic expression::     Basic Expression
@end menu

@node apply code
@subsection Apply Code

The "apply code" selected determines the method of evaluating the
expression.  There are five apply codes, including the non-use
of an apply code.

@table @samp
@item no apply code
This is the most common expression type.
Expressions of this sort come in three flavors:

@table @samp
@item <value-name>
The result is the value of @code{value-name}, if defined.
Otherwise it is the empty string.

@item <basic-expr>
The result of the basic expression is the result of the full expression,
@xref{basic expression}.

@item <value-name> <basic-expr>
If there is a defined value for @code{value-name}, then the @code{basic-expr}
is evaluated.  Otherwise, the result is the empty string.
@end table

@item % <value-name> <basic-expr>
If @code{value-name} is defined, use @code{basic-expr} as a format
string for sprintf.  Then, if the @code{basic-expr} is either a back-quoted
string or a parenthesized expression, then hand the result to the
appropriate interpreter for further evaluation.  Otherwise, for single
and double quote strings, the result is the result of the sprintf operation.
Naturally, if @code{value-name} is not defined, the result is the empty
string.

For example, assume that @code{fumble} had the string value, @code{stumble}:
@example
[+ % fumble `printf '%%x\\n' $%s` +]
@end example
This would cause the shell to evaluate "@code{printf '%x\n' $stumble}".
Assuming that the shell variable @code{stumble} had a numeric value,
the expression result would be that number, in hex.  Note the need
for doubled percent characters and backslashes.

@item ? <value-name> <basic-expr-1> <basic-expr-2>
Two @code{basic-expr}-s are required.  If the @code{value-name} is
defined, then the first @code{basic-expr-1} is evaluated, otherwise
@code{basic-expr-2} is.

@item - <value-name> <basic-expr>
Evaluate @code{basic-expr} only if @code{value-name} is @i{not} defined.

@item ?% <value-name> <basic-expr-1> <basic-expr-2>
This combines the functions of @samp{?} and @samp{%}.  If @code{value-name} is
defined, it behaves exactly like @samp{%}, above, using @code{basic-expr-1}.
If not defined, then @code{basic-expr-2} is evaluated.

For example, assume again that @code{fumble} had the string value, @code{stumble}:
@example
[+ ?% fumble `cat $%s` `pwd` +]
@end example
This would cause the shell to evaluate "@code{cat $stumble}".
If @code{fumble} were not defined, then the result would be the name
of our current directory.
@end table

@node basic expression
@subsection Basic Expression

A basic expression can have one of the following forms:

@table @samp
@item 'STRING'
A single quoted string.  Backslashes can be used to protect single
quotes (@code{'}), hash characters (@code{#}), or backslashes (@code{\})
in the string.  All other characters of STRING are output as-is when the
single quoted string is evaluated.  Backslashes are processed before the hash
character for consistency with the definition syntax.  It is needed there
to avoid preprocessing conflicts.

@item "STRING"
A double quoted string.  This is a cooked text string as in C,
except that they are not concatenated with adjacent strings.
Evaluating "@code{STRING}" will output STRING with all
backslash sequences interpreted.

@item `STRING`
A back quoted string.  When this expression is evaluated, STRING
is first interpreted as a cooked string (as in `"STRING"') and
evaluated as a shell expression by the AutoGen server shell.  This
expression is replaced by the @file{stdout} output of
the shell.

@item (STRING)
A parenthesized expression.  It will be passed to the Guile
interpreter for evaluation and replaced by the resulting value.
If there is a Scheme error in this expression, Guile 1.4 and Guile 1.6
will report the template line number where the error occurs.  Guile 1.7
has lost this capability.

Guile has the capability of creating and manipulating variables that
can be referenced later on in the template processing.  If you define
such a variable, it is invisible to AutoGen.  To reference its value,
you must use a Guile expression.  For example,
@example
[+ (define my-var "some-string-value") +]
@end example
can have that string inserted later, but only as in:
@example
[+ (. my-var) +]
@end example

Additionally, other than in the @code{%} and @code{?%} expressions, the
Guile expressions may be introduced with the Guile comment character
(@code{;}) and you may put a series of Guile expressions within a single
macro.  They will be implicitly evaluated as if they were arguments
to the @code{(begin ...)} expression.  The result will be the
result of the last Guile expression evaluated.

@section AutoGen Native Macros
@cindex native macros

This section describes the various AutoGen natively defined macros.
Unlike the Scheme functions, some of these macros are "block macros"
with a scope that extends through a terminating macro.  Block macros
must not overlap.  That is to say, a block macro started within the
scope of an encompassing block macro must have its matching end macro
appear before the encompassing block macro is either ended or subdivided.

The block macros are these:

@table @code
@item CASE
This macro has scope through the @code{ESAC} macro.
The scope is subdivided by @code{SELECT} macros.
You must have at least one @code{SELECT} macro.

@item DEFINE
This macro has scope through the @code{ENDDEF} macro.  The defined
user macro can never be a block macro.  This macro is extracted from
the template @i{before} the template is processed.  Consequently, you
cannot select a definition based on context.  You can, however, place
them all at the end of the file.

@item FOR
This macro has scope through the @code{ENDFOR} macro.

@item IF
This macro has scope through the @code{ENDIF} macro.
The scope may be subdivided by @code{ELIF} and @code{ELSE}
macros.  Obviously, there may be only one @code{ELSE} macro
and it must be the last of these subdivisions.

@item INCLUDE
This macro has the scope of the included file.
It is a block macro in the sense that the included
file must not contain any incomplete block macros.

@node output controls
@section Redirecting Output
@cindex Redirecting Output
@cindex diversion

AutoGen provides a means for redirecting the template output to different
files or, in @file{M4} parlance, to various diversions.  It is accomplished
by providing a set of Scheme functions named @code{out-*}
(@pxref{AutoGen Functions}).

@table @samp
@item out-push-new (@pxref{SCM out-push-new})
This allows you to logically "push" output files onto a stack.
If you supply a string name, then a file by that name is created
to hold the output.  If you do not supply a name, then the text is
written to a scratch pad and retrieved by passing a ``@code{#t}'' argument
to the @code{out-pop} (@pxref{SCM out-pop}) function.

@item out-pop (@pxref{SCM out-pop})
This function closes the current output file and resumes output to the next
one in the stack.  At least one output must have been pushed onto the output
stack with the @code{out-push-new} (@pxref{SCM out-push-new}) function.  If
``@code{#t}'' is passed in as an argument, then the entire contents of the
diversion (or file) is returned.

@item out-suspend (@pxref{SCM out-suspend})
This function does not close the current output, but instead sets it aside
for resumption by the given name with @code{out-resume}.  The current output
must have been pushed on the output queue with @code{out-push-new}
(@pxref{SCM out-push-new}).

@item out-resume (@pxref{SCM out-resume})
This will put a named file descriptor back onto the top of
stack so that it becomes the current output again.

@item out-switch (@pxref{SCM out-switch})
This closes the current output and creates a new file,
purging any preexisting one.  This is a shortcut for "pop"
followed by "push", but this can also be done at the base level.

@item out-move (@pxref{SCM out-move})
Renames the current output file without closing it.
@end table

There are also several functions for determining the output
status.  @xref{AutoGen Functions}.

@node shell commands
@section Shell Output Commands

Shell commands are run inside of a server process.  This means that,
unlike @file{make}, context is kept from one command to the next.
Consequently, you can define a shell function in one place inside of
your template and invoke it in another.  You may also store values
in shell variables for later reference.  If you load functions from
a file containing shell functions, they will remain until AutoGen exits.

If your shell script should determine that AutoGen should stop
processing, the recommended method for stopping AutoGen is:
@example
die "some error text"
@end example

@noindent
That is a shell function added by AutoGen.  It will send a SIGTERM
to autogen and exit from the "persistent" shell.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node guile macros

Guile also maintains context from one command to the next.  This means you may
define functions and variables in one place and reference them elsewhere.
You also may load Guile macro definitions from a Scheme file by using the
@code{--load-scheme} command line option (@pxref{autogen load-scheme}).
Beware, however, that the AutoGen specific scheme functions have not been
loaded at this time, so though you may define functions that reference them,
do not invoke the AutoGen functions at this time.

If your Scheme script should determine that AutoGen should stop
processing, the recommended method for stopping AutoGen is:
@example

@section Guile Callout Functions

Callout functions must be registered with Guile to work.  This can
be accomplished either by putting your routines into a shared library
that contains a @code{void scm_init( void )} routine that registers
these routines, or by building them into AutoGen.

To build them into AutoGen, you must place your routines in the source
directory and name the files @file{exp*.c}.  You also must have a stylized
comment that @file{getdefs} can find that conforms to the following:

@example
/*=gfunc <function-name>

You must have this exactly thus.

@item <function-name>

@item <short one-liner>
This should be about a half a line long.
It is used as a subsection title in this document.

@item general_use:
You must supply this unless you are an AutoGen maintainer and are writing
a function that queries or modifies the state of AutoGen.

@item <invocation-name-string>
Normally, the @code{function-name} string will be transformed into
a reasonable invocation name.  However, that is not always true.
If the result does not suit your needs, then supply an alternate string.

@item exparg:
You must supply one for each argument to your function.

@node AutoGen macros
@section AutoGen Macros

There are two kinds@:  those you define yourself and AutoGen native.
The user-defined macros may be defined in your templates or loaded
with the @code{--lib-template} option
(See @ref{DEFINE} and  @ref{autogen lib-template}).

As for AutoGen native macros, do not add any. It is easy to do, but I
won't like it.  The basic functions needed to accomplish looping over
and selecting blocks of text have proved to be sufficient over a period
of several years.  New text transformations can be easily added via any
of the AutoGen extension methods, as discussed above.

@section Configuring AutoGen
@cindex configuring

AutoGen is configured and built using Libtool, Automake and Autoconf.
Consequently, you can install it wherever you wish using the various
@samp{--prefix} options.  To the various configuration options supplied
by these tools, AutoGen adds a few of its own:

@table @samp
@item --disable-shell
AutoGen is now capable of acting as a CGI forms server, @xref{AutoGen CGI}.
As such, it will gather its definitions using either @samp{GET} or
@samp{POST} methods.  All you need to do is have a template named
@file{cgi.tpl} handy or specify a different one with a command line
option.

However, doing this without disabling the server shell brings
considerable risk.  If you were to pass user input to a script
that contained, say, the classic "@samp{`rm -rf /`}", you might have
a problem.  This configuration option will cause shell template
commands to simply return the command string as the result.
No mistakes.  Much safer.  Strongly recommended.
The default is to have server shell scripting enabled.

Disabling the shell will have some build side effects, too.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Many of the make check tests will fail, since they assume
a working server shell.
@item
The getdefs and columns programs are not built.
The options are distributed as definition files and they
cannot be expanded with a shell-disabled AutoGen.
@item
Similarly, the documentation cannot be regenerated because
the documentation templates depend on subshell functionality.
@end itemize

@item --enable-debug
Turning on AutoGen debugging enables very detailed inspection of
the input definitions and monitoring shell script processing.
These options are not particularly useful to anyone not directly
involved in maintaining AutoGen.  If you do choose to enable AutoGen
debugging, be aware that the usage page was generated without these
options, so when the build process reaches the documentation rebuild,
there will be a failure.  @samp{cd} into the @file{agen5} build
directory, @samp{make} the @samp{autogen.texi} file and all will
be well thereafter.

@item --with-regex-header
@itemx --with-header-path
@itemx --with-regex-lib
These three work together to specify how to compile with and link to
a particular POSIX regular expression library.  The value for
@file{--with-regex-header=value} must be the name of the relevant header
file.  The AutoGen sources will attempt to include that source with
a @code{#include <value>} C preprocessing statement.  The @code{path} from the
@file{--with-header-path=path} will be added to @code{CPPFLAGS} as @file{-Ipath}.
The @code{lib-specs} from @file{--with-regex-lib=lib-specs} will be added
to @code{LDFLAGS} without any adornment.
@end table

@c === SECTION MARKER

@page
@node AutoGen CGI
@section AutoGen as a CGI server

AutoGen is now capable of acting as a CGI forms server.
It behaves as a CGI server if the definitions input is from stdin
and the environment variable @code{REQUEST_METHOD} is defined
and set to either "GET" or "POST".  If set to anything else,
AutoGen will exit with a failure message.  When set to one of those
values, the CGI data will be converted to AutoGen definitions
(@pxref{Definitions File}) and the template named "@code{cgi.tpl}"
will be processed.

This works by including the name of the real template to process
in the form data and having the "@code{cgi.tpl}" template include
that template for processing.  I do this for processing the form
@url{http://autogen.sourceforge.net/conftest.html}.  The "@code{cgi.tpl}"
looks approximately like this:

@example
<? AutoGen5 Template ?>
<?
IF (not (exist? "template"))                       ?><?
  form-error                                       ?><?

ELIF (=* (get "template") "/")                     ?><?
  form-error                                       ?><?

ELIF (define tpl-file (string-append "cgi-tpl/"
                      (get "template")))
     (access? tpl-file R_OK)                       ?><?
  INCLUDE (. tpl-file)                             ?><?

ELIF (set! tpl-file (string-append tpl-file ".tpl"))
     (access? tpl-file R_OK)                       ?><?
  INCLUDE (. tpl-file)                             ?><?

ELSE                                               ?><?
  form-error                                       ?><?
ENDIF                                              ?>
@end example

@noindent
This forces the template to be found in the "@code{cgi-tpl/}"
directory.  Note also that there is no suffix specified in the
pseudo macro (@pxref{pseudo macro}).  That tells AutoGen to emit
the output to @file{stdout}.

The output is actually spooled until it is complete so that,
in the case of an error, the output can be discarded and a proper
error message can be written in its stead.

@strong{Please also note} that it is advisable, @emph{especially} for network
accessible machines, to configure AutoGen (@pxref{configuring}) with
shell processing disabled (@code{--disable-shell}).  That will make it
impossible for any referenced template to hand data to a subshell for
interpretation.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node signal names
@section Signal Names
@cindex Signal Names

When AutoGen is first built, it tries to use @code{psignal(3)},
@code{sys_siglist}, @code{strsigno(3)} and @code{strsignal(3)} from the
host operating system.  If your system does not supply these, the
AutoGen distribution will.  However, it will use the distributed mapping
and this mapping is unlikely to match what your system uses.  This can
be fixed.  Once you have installed autogen, the mapping can be rebuilt
on the host operating system.  To do so, you must perform the
following steps:

@enumerate
@item
Build and install AutoGen in a place where it will be found in your
search path.

@item
@code{cd $@{top_srcdir@}/compat}

@item
@code{autogen strsignal.def}

@item
Verify the results by examining the @file{strsignal.h} file produced.

@item
Re-build and re-install AutoGen.
@end enumerate

If you have any problems or peculiarities that cause this process to
fail on your platform, please send me copies of the header files
containing the signal names and numbers, along with the full path names
of these files.  I will endeavor to fix it.  There is a shell script
inside of @file{strsignal.def} that tries to hunt down the information.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node installing
@section Installing AutoGen
@cindex Installing

There are several files that get installed.  The number depend
whether or not both shared and archive libraries are to be
installed.  The following assumes that everything is installed
relative to @code{$prefix}.  You can, of course, use
@code{configure} to place these files where you wish.

@strong{NB}@:  AutoGen does not contain any compiled-in path names.
All support directories are located via option processing,
the environment variable @code{HOME} or finding the directory where
the executable came from.

The installed files are:

@enumerate
@item
The executables in @file{bin} (autogen, getdefs and columns).

@item
The AutoOpts link libraries as @file{lib/libopts.*}.

@item
An include file in @file{include/options.h}, needed for
Automated Option Processing (see next chapter).

@item
Several template files and a scheme script in @file{share/autogen}, needed
for Automated Option Processing (@pxref{AutoOpts}), parsing definitions
written with scheme syntax (@pxref{Dynamic Text}), the templates for
producing documentation for your program (@pxref{documentation attributes}),
autoconf test macros, and AutoFSM.

@item
Info-style help files as @file{info/autogen.info*}.
These files document AutoGen, the option processing
library AutoOpts, and several add-on components.

@item
The three man pages for the three executables are installed in man/man1.
@end enumerate

This program, library and supporting files can be installed
with three commands:

@itemize @bullet
@item
<src-dir>/configure [ <configure-options> ]
@item
make
@item
make install
@end itemize

However, you may wish to insert @code{make check}
before the @code{make install} command.

If you do perform a @code{make check} and there are any failures, you
will find the results in @code{<module>/test/FAILURES}.  Needless to say, I
would be interested in seeing the contents of those files and any
associated messages.  If you choose to go on and analyze one of these
failures, you will need to invoke the test scripts individually.  You
may do so by specifying the test (or list of test) in the TESTS make
variable, thus:

@example
gmake TESTS=test-name.test check
@end example

I specify @code{gmake} because most makes will not let you override
internal definitions with command line arguments.  @code{gmake} does.

All of the AutoGen tests are written to honor the contents of the
@t{VERBOSE} environment variable.  Normally, any commentary generated
during a test run is discarded unless the @t{VERBOSE} environment
variable is set.  So, to see what is happening during the test, you
might invoke the following with @i{bash} or @i{ksh}:

@example
VERBOSE=1 gmake TESTS="for.test forcomma.test" check
@end example

@noindent
Or equivalently with @i{csh}:

@example
env VERBOSE=1 gmake TESTS="for.test forcomma.test" check
@end example

@node AutoEvents
@section Automated Event Management
@cindex AutoEvents

Large software development projects invariably have a need to manage
the distribution and display of state information and state changes.
In other words, they need to manage their software events.  Generally,
each such project invents its own way of accomplishing this and then
struggles to get all of its components to play the same way.  It is a
difficult process and not always completely successful.  This project
helps with that.

AutoEvents completely separates the tasks of supplying the data
needed for a particular event from the methods used to manage the
distribution and display of that event.  Consequently, the programmer
writing the code no longer has to worry about that part of the
problem.  Likewise the persons responsible for designing the event
management and distribution no longer have to worry about getting
programmers to write conforming code.

This is a work in progress.  See my
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/autogen/autoevents.html,web page}
on the subject, if you are interested.
I have some useful things put together, but it is not ready
to call a product.

@node Features
@section AutoOpts Features
@cindex features

AutoOpts supports option processing; option state saving; and
program documentation with innumerable features.  Here, we list
a few obvious ones and some important ones, but the full list is
really defined by all the attributes defined in the @ref{Option Definitions}
section.

@enumerate
@item
POSIX-compliant short (flag) option processing.

@item
GNU-style long options processing.  Long options
are recognized without case sensitivity, and they may be abbreviated.

@item
Environment variable initializations, @xref{environrc}.

@item
Initialization from configuration files (aka RC or INI files), and
saving the option state back into one, @xref{loading rcfile}.

@item
Config files may be partitioned.  One config file may be used by several
programs by partitioning it with lines containing,
``@code{[PROGRAM_NAME]}'' or ``@code{<?program-name>}'', @xref{loading rcfile}.

@item
Options may be marked as @code{@i{dis}-abled} with a disablement prefix.
Such options may default to either an enabled or a disabled state.  You
may also provide an enablement prefix, too, e.g., @code{--allow-mumble}
and @code{--prevent-mumble} (@pxref{Common Attributes}).

@item
Verify that required options are present between the minimum and maximum
number of times on the command line.  Verify that conflicting options do not
appear together.  Verify that options requiring the presence of other options
are, in fact, used in the presence of other options.
See @xref{Common Attributes}, and @xref{Option Conflict Attributes}.

@item
There are several @ref{automatic options, automatically supported options}.
They will have short flags if any options have option flags and the flags
are not suppressed.  The associated flag may be altered or suppressed by
specifying no value or an alternate character for ``@code{xxx-value;}'' in
the option definition file.  ``@code{xxx}'' is the name of the option below:

@table @samp
@item --help
@itemx --more-help
These are always available.  ``@code{more-help}'' will pass the full usage
text through a pager.
@item --usage
@vindex usage-opt
This is added to the option list if ``@code{usage-opt}'' is specified.
It yields the abbreviated usage to @file{stdout}.
@item --version
This is added to the option list if ``@code{version = xxx;}'' is specified.
@item --load-opts
@itemx --save-opts
These are added to the option list if ``@code{homerc}'' is specified.
@end table

@item
Various forms of main procedures can be added to the output,
@xref{Generated main}.  There are four basic forms:

@enumerate a
@item
A program that processes the arguments and writes to standard out
portable shell commands containing the digested options.

@item
A program that will generate portable shell commands to parse the defined
options.  The expectation is that this result will be copied into a
shell script and used there.

@item
A ``for-each'' main that will invoke a named function once for either
each non-option argument on the command line or, if there are none,
then once for each non-blank, non-comment input line read from stdin.

@item
A main procedure of your own design.  Its code can be supplied in the
option description template or by incorporating another template.
@end enumerate

@item
There are several methods for handling option arguments.
@itemize @bullet
@item
nothing (@pxref{OPT_ARG}) option argument strings are globally available.
@item
user supplied (@pxref{Option Argument Handling})
@item
stack option arguments (@pxref{Option Argument Handling})
@item
integer numbers (@pxref{arg-type number})
@item
true or false valued (@pxref{arg-type boolean})
@item
enumerated list of names (@pxref{arg-type keyword})
@item
an enumeration (membership) set (@pxref{arg-type set membership})
@item
a list of name/value pairs (option ``subopts'') (@pxref{arg-type hierarchy})
@item
validated file name (@pxref{arg-type file name})
@item
optional option argument (@pxref{arg-optional})
@end itemize

@item
The generated usage text can be emitted in either AutoOpts standard
format (maximizing the information about each option), or GNU-ish
normal form.  The default form is selected by either specifying or not
specifying the @code{gnu-usage} attribute (@pxref{information attributes}).
This can be overridden by the user himself with the
@code{AUTOOPTS_USAGE} environment variable.  If it exists and is set
to the string @code{gnu}, it will force GNU-ish style format; if it is
set to the string @code{autoopts}, it will force AutoOpts standard
format; otherwise, it will have no effect.

@item
If you compile with @code{ENABLE_NLS} defined and @code{_()} defined to
a localization function such as @code{gettext(3GNU)}, then the option
processing code will be localizable (@pxref{i18n}).

@item
Provides a callable routine to parse
a text string as if it were from one of the rc/ini/config files,
hereafter referred to as a configuration file.

@item
By adding a @samp{doc} and @samp{arg-name} attributes to each option,
AutoGen will also be able to produce a man page and the @samp{invoking}
section of a texinfo document.

@item
Intermingled option processing.  AutoOpts options may be intermingled with
command line operands and options processed with other parsing techniques.
This is accomplished by setting the @code{allow-errors}
(@pxref{program attributes}) attribute.  When processing reaches a point
where @code{optionProcess} (@pxref{libopts-optionProcess}) needs to be called
again, the current option can be set with @code{RESTART_OPT(n)}
(@pxref{RESTART_OPT}) before calling @code{optionProcess}.

See: @xref{library attributes}.

@item
Library suppliers can specify command line options that their
client programs will accept.  They specify option definitions
that get @code{#include}-d into the client option definitions
and they specify an "anchor" option that has a callback and must be invoked.
That will give the library access to the option state for their options.

@item
library options.  An AutoOpt-ed library may export its options for use in
an AutoOpt-ed program.  This is done by providing an option definition file
that client programs @code{#include} into their own option definitions.
See ``AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed Program'' (@pxref{lib and program})
for more details.

@item
Insert the option processing state into Scheme-defined variables.
Thus, Guile based applications that are linked with private
@code{main()} routines can take advantage of all of AutoOpts' functionality.
@end enumerate

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Licensing
@section AutoOpts Licensing
@cindex Licensing

When AutoGen is installed, the AutoOpts project is installed with it.
AutoOpts includes various AutoGen templates and a pair of shared
libraries.  These libraries may be used under the terms of version 3
of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

One of these libraries (@code{libopts}) is needed by programs that are built
using AutoOpts generated code.  This library is available as a separate
``tear-off'' source tarball.  It is redistributable for use under either of
two licenses: The above mentioned GNU Lesser General Public License, and
the advertising-clause-free BSD license.  Both of these license terms are
incorporated into appropriate COPYING files included with the @code{libopts}
source tarball.  This source may be incorporated into your package with
the following simple commands:

@example
rm -rf libopts libopts-*
gunzip -c `autoopts-config libsrc` | \
   tar -xvf -
mv libopts-*.*.* libopts
@end example

View the @file{libopts/README} file for further integration information.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@page
@node Caveats
@section Cautionary Notes

The templates used to implement AutoOpts depend heavily upon
token pasting.  That mens that if you name an option, ``debug'', for
example, the generated header will expect to be able to emit
@code{#define} macros such as this:
@example
#define DESC(n) (autogenOptions.pOptDesc[INDEX_OPT_## n])
@end example
and expect @code{DESC(DEBUG)} to expand correctly into
@code{(autogenOptions.pOptDesc[INDEX_OPT_DEBUG])}.
If @code{DEBUG} is @code{#defined} to something else, then
that something else will be in the above expansion.

If you discover you are having strange problems like this,
you may wish to use some variation of the @code{guard-option-names}
@xref{program attributes}.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@page
@node Quick Start
@section Quick Start
@cindex example, simple AutoOpts

Since it is generally easier to start with a simple example than it is
to look at the options that AutoGen uses itself, here is a very simple
AutoOpts example.  You can copy this example out of the Info file and
into a source file to try it.  You can then embellish it into what you
really need.  For more extensive examples, you can also examine the help
output and option definitions for the commands @code{columns},
@code{getdefs} and @code{autogen} itself.

For our simple example, assume you have a program named @code{check}
that takes two options:

@enumerate
@item
A list of directories to check over for whatever it is @code{check} does.
You want this option available as a POSIX-style flag option
and a GNU long option.  You want to allow as many of these
as the user wishes.
@item
An option to show or not show the definition tree being used.
Only one occurrence is to be allowed, specifying one or the other.
@end enumerate

@end ignore

@ignore
START == AUTOOPTS-MAIN == DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT or the surrounding 'ignore's

@end ignore

@noindent
Normally, however, you would compile @file{checkopt.c} as in:

@example
cc -o checkopt.o $cflags -c checkopt.c
@end example

@noindent
and link @file{checkopt.o} with the rest of your program.
The main program causes the options to be processed
by calling @code{optionProcess} (@pxref{libopts-optionProcess}):

@example
main( int argc, char** argv )
@{
  @{
    int optct = optionProcess( &checkOptions, argc, argv );
    argc -= optct;
    argv += optct;
  @}
@end example

The options are tested and used as in the following fragment.
``@code{ENABLED_OPT}'' is used instead of ``@code{HAVE_OPT}'' for the
@code{show-defs} option because it is an enabled/disabled option type:

@example
  if (  ENABLED_OPT( SHOW_DEFS )
     && HAVE_OPT( CHECK_DIRS )) @{
    int    dirct = STACKCT_OPT( CHECK_DIRS );
    char** dirs  = STACKLST_OPT( CHECK_DIRS );
    while (dirct-- > 0) @{
      char* dir = *dirs++;
      ...
@end example

A lot of magic happens to make this happen.
The rest of this chapter will describe the myriad of option attributes
supported by AutoOpts.  However, keep in mind that, in general, you won't
need much more than what was described in this "quick start" section.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Option Definitions
@section Option Definitions
@cindex Option Definitions

AutoOpts uses an AutoGen definitions file for the definitions of the
program options and overall configuration attributes.
The complete list of program and option attributes is quite extensive,
so if you are reading to understand how to use AutoOpts, I recommend
reading the "Quick Start" section (@pxref{Quick Start}) and paying
attention to the following:

@enumerate
@item
@code{prog-name}, @code{prog-title}, and @code{argument}, program
attributes, @xref{program attributes}.
@item
@code{name} and @code{descrip} option attributes, @xref{Required Attributes}.
@item
@code{value} (flag character) and @code{min} (occurrence counts)
option attributes, @xref{Common Attributes}.
@item
@code{arg-type} from the option argument specification section,
@xref{Option Arguments}.
@item
Read the overall how to, @xref{Using AutoOpts}.
@item
Highly recommended, but not required, are the several "man" and
"info" documentation attributes, @xref{documentation attributes}.
@end enumerate

Keep in mind that the majority are rarely used and can be safely
ignored.  However, when you have special option processing requirements,
the flexibility is there.

The following global definitions are used to define attributes of the entire
program.  These generally alter the configuration or global behavior of the
AutoOpts option parser.  The first two are required of every program.  The
third is required if there are to be any left over arguments (operands)
after option processing.  The rest have been alphabetized.  Except as noted,
there may be only one copy of each of these definitions:

@table @samp
@item prog-name
@vindex prog-name
This attribute is required.  Variable names derived from this name
are derived using @code{string->c_name!} (@pxref{SCM string->c-name!}).

@item prog-title
@vindex prog-title
This attribute is required and may be any descriptive text.

@item argument
@vindex argument
This attribute is required if your program uses operand arguments.
It specifies the syntax of the arguments that @strong{follow} the options.
It may not be empty, but if it is not supplied, then option processing
must consume all the arguments.  If it is supplied and starts with an
open bracket (@code{[}), then there is no requirement on the presence or
absence of command line arguments following the options.  Lastly, if it
is supplied and does not start with an open bracket, then option
processing must @strong{not} consume all of the command line arguments.

@item allow-errors
@vindex allow-errors
The presence of this attribute indicates ignoring any command line
option errors.  This may also be turned on and off by invoking the
macros @code{ERRSKIP_OPTERR} and @code{ERRSTOP_OPTERR} from the
generated interface file.

@item config-header
@vindex config-header
The contents of this attribute should be just the name of the configuration
file.  A "#include" naming this file will be inserted at the top of the
generated header.

@item disable-load
@itemx disable-save
@vindex disable-load
@vindex disable-save
Indicates that the command line usage of @code{--load-opts} and/or
@code{--save-opts} are disallowed.

@item environrc
@vindex environrc
Indicates looking in the environment for values of variables named,
@code{PROGRAM_OPTNAME} or @code{PROGRAM}, where @code{PROGRAM} is the
upper cased @code{C-name} of the program and @code{OPTNAME} is the
upper cased @code{C-name} of a specific option.

@item export
@vindex export
This string is inserted into the .h interface file.  Generally used for
global variables or @code{#include} directives required by
@code{flag-code} text and shared with other program text.
Do not specify your configuration header (@file{config.h}) in this
attribute or the @code{include} attribute, however.  Instead, use
@code{config-header}, above.n.

@item full-usage
@vindex full-usage
If this attribute is provided, it may specify the full length
usage text, or a variable name assignable to a ``char const *'' pointer,
or it may be empty.  The meanings are determined by  the length.
@itemize @bullet
@item
If not provided, the text will be computed as normal.
@item
If the length is zero, then the usage text will be derived from
the current settings and inserted as text into the generated .c file.
@item
If the length is 1 to 32 bytes, then it is presumed to be a variable
name that either points to or is an array of const chars.
@item
If it is longer than that, it is presumed to be the help text itself.
This text will be inserted into the generated .c file.
@end itemize

This string should be readily translatable and provision will be made
to translate it if this is provided and the source code is compiled with
``ENABLE_NLS'' defined.

@item guard-option-names
@vindex guard-option-names
AutoOpts generates macros that presume that there are no @code{cpp} macros
with the same name as the option name.  For example, if you have an option
named, @code{debug}, then you must not use @code{#ifdef DEBUG} in your code.
If you specify this attribute, every option name will be guarded.  If the name
is @code{#define}-d, then a warning will be issued and the name undefined.
If you do not specify this and there is a conflict, you will get strange
error messages.

This attribute may be set to any of four recognized states:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Not defined.  AutoOpts will behave as described above.

@item
Defined, but set to the empty string.  Text will be emitted into the header
to undefine (@code{#undef}) any conflicting preprocessor macros.  The code
will include compiler warnings (via @code{#warning}).  Some compilers are
not ANSI-C-99 compliant yet and will error out on those warnings.  You may
compile with @code{-DNO_OPTION_NAME_WARNINGS} to silence or mostly silence
them.

@item
Defined and set to the string, ``@code{no-warning}''.  All of the needed
@code{#undef}s will be emitted, without any conflict checking @code{#warning}
directives emitted.

@item
Defined and set to the string, ``@code{full-enum}''.  The option manipulation
preprocessor macros will not token paste the option names to the index
enumeration prefix.  e.g. you will need to use @code{HAVE_OPT(INDEX_OPT_DEBUG)}
instead of @code{HAVE_OPT(DEBUG)}.
@end itemize

@item homerc
@vindex homerc
Specifies either a directory or a file using a specific path (like @code{.}
or @file{/usr/local/share/progname}) or an environment variable (like
@file{$HOME/rc/} or @file{$PREFIX/share/progname}) or the directory
where the executable was found (@file{$$[/...]}) to use to try to find
the rcfile.  Use as many as you like.  The presence of this attribute
activates the @code{--save-opts} and @code{--load-opts} options.
@xref{loading rcfile}.

@item include
@vindex include
This string is inserted into the .c file.  Generally used for global
variables required only by @code{flag-code} program text.

@item long-opts
@vindex long-opts
@cindex named option mode
Presence indicates GNU-standard long option processing.  If any options
do not have an option value (flag character) specified, and least one
does specify such a value, then you must specify @code{long-opts}.  If
none of your options specify an option value (flag character) and you do
not specify @code{long-opts}, then command line arguments are processed
in "named option mode".  This means that:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Every command line argument must be a long option.
@item
The flag markers @code{-} and @code{--} are completely optional.
@item
The @code{argument} program attribute is disallowed.
@item
One of the options may be specified as the default
(as long as it has a required option argument).
@end itemize

@item no-libopts
@vindex no-libopts
If you are going to handle your option processing with the @code{getopt.tpl}
template instead of using libopts, then specify this attribute.  It will
suppress mention of @code{--more-help} in the generated documentation.

@item no-xlate
@vindex no-xlate
Modifies when or whether option names get translated.  If provided,
it must be assigned one of two values:
@table @samp
@item opt-cfg
to suppress option name translation for configuration file and and environment
variable processing.
@item opt
to suppress option name translation completely.  The usage text will
always be translated if @code{ENABLE_NLS} is defined and you have
translations for that text.
@end table
See also the various ``@code{XLAT}'' interface entries in the
AutoOpts Programmatic Interface section (@pxref{AutoOpts API}).

@item prefix
@vindex prefix
This value is inserted into @strong{all} global names.  This will
disambiguate them if more than one set of options are to be compiled
into a single program.

@item prog-group
@vindex prog-group
The version text in the @file{getopt.tpl} template will include this
text in parentheses after the program name, when this attribute is specified.
For example:
@example
mumble (stumble) 1.0
@end example
@noindent
says that the ``@code{mumble}'' program is version 1.0 and is part of the
``@code{stumble}'' group of programs.

@item rcfile
@vindex rcfile
Specifies the configuration file name.  This is only useful if you
have provided at least one @code{homerc} attribute.
@noindent
default: .<prog-name>rc

@item resettable
@vindex resettable
Specifies that the @code{--reset-option} command line option is to be supported.

@item short-usage
@vindex short-usage
If this attribute is provided, it is used to specify an abbreviated
version of the usage text.  This text is constructed in the same way
as the ``full-usage'', described above.

@item version
@vindex version
Specifies the program version and activates the VERSION option,
@xref{automatic options}.
@end table

@node library attributes
@subsection Options for Library Code
@cindex library attributes

Some libraries provide their own code for processing command line
options, and this may be used by programs that utilize AutoOpts.
You may also wish to write a library that gets configured with AutoOpts
options and config files.  Such a library may either supply its own
configury routine and process its own options, or it may export its
option descriptions to programs that also use AutoOpts.  This section
will describe how to do all of these different things.

@menu
* lib and program::         AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed Program
* lib called::              AutoOpt-ed Library for Regular Program
* prog calls lib::          AutoOpt-ed Program Calls Regular Library
@end menu

@node lib and program
@subsubsection AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed Program

The library source code must provide an option definition file that consists
of only the attribute @code{library}
@vindex library
and @code{flag} entries.  The ``library'' attribute does not need any
associated value, so it will generally appeary by itself on a line folowed
by a semi-colon.  The first @code{flag} entry must contain the following
attributes:

@table @samp
@item name
This name is used in the construction of a global pointer of type
@code{tOptDesc const*}.  It is always required.
@item documentation
@vindex documentation
It tells @code{AutoOpts} that this option serves no normal purpose.
It will be used to add usage clarity and to locate option descriptors
in the library code.
@item descrip
This is a string that is inserted in the extended usage display
before the options specific to the current library.  It is always required.
@item lib-name
@vindex lib-name
This should match the name of the library.  This string is also used in
the construction of the option descriptor pointer name.  In the end, it
looks like this:
@example
extern tOptDesc const* <<lib-name>>_<<name>>_optDesc_p;
@end example
@noindent
and is used in the macros generated for the library's @code{.h} file.
@end table

In order to compile this @code{AutoOpts} using library, you must create a
special header that is not used by the client program.  This is accomplished
by creating an option definition file that contains essentially exactly the
following:

@example
AutoGen definitions options;
prog-name  = does-not-matter;  // but is always required
prog-title = 'also does not matter';  // also required
config-header = 'config.h'; // optional, but common
library;
#include library-options-only.def
@end example

@noindent
and nothing else.  AutoGen will produce only the @code{.h} file.
You may now compile your library, referencing just this @code{.h} file.
The macros it creates will utilize a global variable that will be defined
by the @code{AutoOpts}-using client program.  That program will need to
have the following @code{#include} in @i{its} option definition file:

@example
#include library-options-only.def
@end example

@noindent
All the right things will magically happen so that the global variables
named @code{<<lib-name>>_<<name>>_optDesc_p} are initialized correctly.
For an example, please see the @code{AutoOpts} test script:
@file{autoopts/test/library.test}.

@node lib called
@subsubsection AutoOpt-ed Library for Regular Program

In this case, your library must provide an option processing function
to a calling program.  This is accomplished by setting the @code{allow-errors}
global option attribute.  Each time your option handling function is called,
you must determine where your scan is to resume and tell the AutoOpts library
by invoking:

@example
RESTART_OPT(next_arg_index);
@end example

@noindent
and then invoke @code{not_opt_index = optionProcess(...)}.
The @code{not_opt_index} value can be used to set @code{optind},
if that is the global being used to scan the program argument array.

In this method, do @strong{NOT} utilize the global @code{library} attribute.
Your library must specify its options as if it were a complete program.
You may choose to specify an alternate @code{usage()} function so that
usage for other parts of the option interface may be displayed as well.
See ``Program Information Attributes'' (@pxref{information attributes}).

At the moment, there is no method for calling @code{optionUsage()} telling
it to produce just the information about the options and not the program
as a whole.  Some later revision after somebody asks.

@node prog calls lib
@subsubsection AutoOpt-ed Program Calls Regular Library

As with providing an @code{AutoOpt}-ed library to a non-@code{AutoOpt}-ed
program, you must write the option description file as if you were writing
all the options for the program, but you should specify the
@code{allow-errors} global option attribute and you will likely want an
alternate @code{usage()} function (see ``Program Information Attributes''
@pxref{information attributes}).  In this case, though, when
@code{optionProcess()} returns, you need to test to see if there might be
library options.  If there might be, then call the library's exported
routine for handling command line options, set the next-option-to-process
with the @code{RESTART_OPT()} macro, and recall @code{optionProcess()}.
Repeat until done.

@node Generated main
@subsection Generating main procedures
@cindex main procedure

When AutoOpts generates the code to parse the command line options, it has
the ability to produce any of several types of @code{main()} procedures.
This is done by specifying a global structured value for
@vindex main
@code{main}.  The values that it contains are dependent on the value set for
the one value it must have: @code{main-type}.

@vindex main-type
The recognized values for @code{main-type} are:
@menu
* main guile::              guile: main and inner_main procedures
* main shell-process::      shell-process: emit Bourne shell results
* main shell-parser::       shell-parser: emit Bourne shell script
* main main::               main: user supplied main procedure
* main include::            include: code emitted from included template
* main invoke::             invoke: code emitted from AutoGen macro
* main for-each::           for-each: perform function on each argument
@end menu

Here is an example of an @code{include} variation:

@example
main = @{
  main-type = include;
  tpl       = "main-template.tpl";
@};
@end example

@node main guile
@subsubsection guile: main and inner_main procedures

When the @code{main-type} is specified to be @code{guile},
a @code{main()} procedure is generated that calls @code{gh_enter()}, providing
it with a generated @code{inner_main()} to invoke.  If you must perform
certain tasks before calling @code{gh_enter()}, you may specify such code
in the value for the
@vindex before-guile-boot
@code{before-guile-boot} attribute.

The @code{inner_main()} procedure itself will process the command line
arguments (by calling @code{optionProcess()},
@pxref{libopts-optionProcess}), and then either invoke the code
specified with the
@vindex guile-main
@code{guile-main} attribute, or else export the parsed options to Guile
symbols and invoke the @code{scm_shell()} function from the Guile library.
This latter will render the program nearly identical to the stock
@code{guile(1)} program.

@node main shell-process
@subsubsection shell-process: emit Bourne shell results

This will produce a @code{main()} procedure that parses the command line
options and emits to @file{stdout} Bourne shell commands that puts the
option state into environment variables.  This can be used within a
shell script as follows:

@example
unset OPTION_CT
eval "`opt_parser \"$@@\"`"
test -z "$@{OPTION_CT@}" && exit 1
test $@{OPTION_CT@} -gt 0 && shift $@{OPTION_CT@}
@end example

If the option parsing code detects an error or a request for usage,
it will not emit an assignment to OPTION_CT and the script should just
exit.  If the options are set consistently, then something along the
lines of the following will be written to @file{stdout} and evaled:

@example
    OPTION_CT=4
    export OPTION_CT
    MYPROG_SECOND='first'
    export MYPROG_SECOND
    MYPROG_ANOTHER=1 # 0x1
    export MYPROG_ANOTHER
@end example

@noindent
If the arguments are to be reordered, however, then the resulting set
of operands will be emitted and @code{OPTION_CT} gets set to zero.
For example, the following would be appended to the above:

@example
    set -- 'operand1' 'operand2' 'operand3'
    OPTION_CT=0
@end example

@noindent
@code{OPTION_CT} is set to zero since it is not necessary to shift
off any options.

@node main shell-parser
@subsubsection shell-parser: emit Bourne shell script

This will produce a @code{main()} procedure that emits a shell script
that will parse the command line options.  That script can be emitted
to @file{stdout} or inserted or substituted into a pre-existing shell
script file.  Improbable markers are used to identify previously inserted
parsing text:

@example
# # # # # # # # # # -- do not modify this marker --
@end example

@noindent
The program is also pretty insistent upon starting its parsing script
on the second line.

@node main main
@subsubsection main: user supplied main procedure

You must supply a value for the @code{main-text} attribute.
You may also supply a value for
@vindex option-code
@code{option-code}.  If you do, then the @code{optionProcess} invocation
will not be emitted into the code.  AutoOpts will wrap the @code{main-text}
inside of:

@example
int
main( int argc, char** argv )
@{
    @{ // replaced by option-code, if that exists
        int ct = optionProcess( &<<prog-name>>Options, argc, argv );
        argc -= ct;
        argv += ct;
    @}
<<your main-text goes here>>
@}
@end example

@noindent
so you can most conveniently set the value with a ``@code{here string}''
(@pxref{here-string}):

@example
code = <<- _EndOfMainProc_
	<<your text goes here>>
	_EndOfMainProc_;
@end example

@node main include
@subsubsection include: code emitted from included template

You must write a template to produce your main procedure.
You specify the name of the template with the @code{tpl} attribute
and it will be incorporated at the point where AutoOpts is ready
to emit the @code{main()} procedure.

This can be very useful if, in your working environment, you have
many programs with highly similar @code{main()} procedures.  All you need
to do is parameterize the variations and specify which variant is needed
within the @code{main} AutoOpts specification.  Since you are coding
the template for this, the attributes needed for this variation would
be dictated by your template.

@node main invoke
@subsubsection invoke: code emitted from AutoGen macro

You must write a template to produce your main procedure.  That template
must contain a definition for the function specified with the @code{func}
attribute to this @code{main()} procedure specification.  Typically, this
template will be incorporated by using the @code{--lib-template} option
(@pxref{autogen lib-template}) in the AutoGen invocation.  Otherwise, this
variation operates in much the same way as ``@code{include}''
(@pxref{main include}) method.

@node main for-each
@subsubsection for-each: perform function on each argument

This produces a main procedure that invokes a procedure once for each operand
on the command line (non-option arguments), @strong{OR} once for each
non-blank, non-comment @code{stdin} input line.  Leading and trailing white
space is trimmed from the input line and comment lines are lines that are
empty or begin with a comment character, defaulting to a hash ('#') character.

@strong{NB}:
The @code{argument} program attribute (@pxref{program attributes})
must begin with the @code{[} character, to indicate that there are
command operands, but that they are optional.

There are a number of attributes to @code{main} that may be used:

@table @code
@item  handler-proc
@vindex handler-proc
This attribute is required.  It is used to name the procedure to call.
That procedure is presumed to be external, but if you provide the code
for it, then the procedure is emitted as a static procedure in the
generated code.

This procedure should return 0 on success, a cumulative error code on warning
and exit without returning on an unrecoverable error.  As the cumulative
warning codes are @i{or}-ed together, the codes should be some sort of bit
mask in order to be ultimately decipherable (if you need to do that).

If the called procedure needs to cause a fail-exit, it is expected to call
@code{exit(3)} directly.  If you want to cause a warning exit code, then this
handler function should return a non-zero status.  That value will be
@strong{OR}-ed into a result integer for computing the final exit code.  E.g.,
here is part of the emitted code:

@example
  int res = 0;
  if (argc > 0) @{
     do  @{
         res |= @i{my_handler}( *(argv++) );
     @} while (--argc > 0);
  @} else @{ ...
@end example

@item handler-type
@vindex handler-type
If you do not supply this attribute, your handler procedure must be
the default type.  The profile of the procedure must be:

@example
int @i{my_handler}( char const *pz_entry );
@end example

@noindent
However, if you do supply this attribute, you may set the value to any of
four alternate flavors:

@table @samp
@item name-of-file
This is essentially the same as the default handler type, except that before
your procedure is invoked, the generated code has verified that the string
names an existing file.  The profile is unchanged.

@item file-X
Before calling your procedure, the file is f-opened according to the ``X'',
where ``X'' may be any of the legal modes for @code{fopen(3C)}.  In this case,
the profile for your procedure must be:

@example
int @i{my_handler}( char const* pz_fname, FILE* entry_fp );
@end example

@item  text-of-file
@itemx some-text-of-file
Before calling your procedure, the contents of the file are read into memory.
(Excessively large files may cause problems.)  The ``@samp{some-text-of-file}''
disallows empty files.  Both require regular files.  In this case, the profile
for your procedure must be:

@example
int @i{my_handler}( char const* pz_fname, char* file_text,
                size_t text_size );
@end example

@noindent
Note that though the @code{file_text} is not @code{const}, any changes made to
it are not written back to the original file.  It is merely a memory image of
the file contents.  Also, the memory allocated to hold the text is
@code{text_size + 1} bytes long and the final byte is always @code{NUL}.
The file contents need not be text, as the data are read with the @code{read(2)}
system call.
@end table

@item @i{my_handler}-code
@vindex MYHANDLER-code
With this attribute, you provide the code for your handler procedure
in the option definition file.  In this case, your @code{main()}
procedure specification might look something like this:

@example
main = @{
  main-type    = for-each;
  handler-proc = @i{my_handler};
  @i{my_handler}-code = <<- EndOfMyCode
	/* whatever you want to do */
	EndOfMyCode;
@};
@end example

@noindent
and instead of an emitted external reference, a procedure will be emitted
that looks like this:

@example
static int
@i{my_handler}( char const* pz_entry )
@{
    int res = 0;
    <<@i{my_handler}-code goes here>>
    return res;
@}
@end example

@item main-init
@vindex main-init
This is code that gets inserted after the options have been processed, but
before the handler procs get invoked.

@item main-fini
@vindex main-fini
This is code that gets inserted after all the entries have been processed,
just before returning from @code{main()}.

@item comment-char
@vindex comment-char
If you wish comment lines to start with a character other than a hash
(@code{#}) character, then specify one character with this attribute.
If that character is the @code{NUL} byte, then only blank lines will be
considered comments.
@end table

@node information attributes
@subsection Program Information Attributes
@cindex information attributes

These attributes are used to define how and what information is displayed
to the user of the program.

@table @samp
@item copyright
@vindex copyright
The @code{copyright} is a structured value containing three to five
values.  If @code{copyright} is used, then the first three are required.

@enumerate
@item
@vindex date
@file{date} - the list of applicable dates for the copyright.
@item
@vindex owner
@file{owner} - the name of the copyright holder.
@item
@vindex type
@file{type} - specifies the type of distribution license.
AutoOpts/AutoGen will automatically support the text of the GNU Public
License (@file{GPL}), the GNU General Public License with Library extensions
(@file{LGPL}), the Free BSD license (@file{BSD}), and a
write-it-yourself copyright notice (@file{NOTE}).  Only these values are
recognized.
@item
@vindex text
@file{text} - the text of the copyright notice.  It is only needed
if @file{type} is set to @file{NOTE}.
@item
@vindex author
@file{author} - in case the author name is to appear in the documentation
and is different from the copyright owner.
@item
@vindex eaddr
@file{eaddr} - email address for receiving praises and complaints.
Typically that of the author or copyright holder.
@end enumerate
@*
An example of this might be:
@example
copyright = @{
    date  = "1992-2008";
    owner = "Bruce Korb";
    eaddr = 'bkorb@@gnu.org';
    type  = GPL;
@};
@end example

@item detail
@vindex detail
This string is added to the usage output when the HELP option is
selected.

@item explain
@vindex explain
Gives additional information whenever the usage routine is invoked..

@item package
@vindex package
The name of the package the program belongs to.  This will appear
parenthetically after the program name in the version and usage output,
e.g.:  @code{autogen @i{(GNU autogen)} - The Automated Program Generator}.

@item preserve-case
@vindex preserve-case
This attribute will not change anything except appearance.
Normally, the option names are all documented in lower case.
However, if you specify this attribute, then they will display
in the case used in their specification.  Command line options
will still be matched without case sensitivity.

@item prog-desc @strong{and}
@itemx opts-ptr
@vindex prog-desc
@vindex opts-ptr
These define global pointer variables that point to the program
descriptor and the first option descriptor for a library option.  This
is intended for use by certain libraries that need command line and/or
initialization file option processing.  These definitions have no effect
on the option template output, but are used for creating a library
interface file.  Normally, the first "option" for a library will be a
documentation option that cannot be specified on the command line, but
is marked as @code{settable}.  The library client program will invoke the
@code{SET_OPTION} macro which will invoke a handler function that will
finally set these global variables.

@item usage
@vindex usage
Optionally names the usage procedure, if the library routine
@code{optionUsage()} does not work for you.  If you specify
@code{my_usage} as the value of this attribute, for example, you will
use a procedure by that name for displaying usage.  Of course, you will
need to provide that procedure and it must conform to this profile:
@example
void @i{my_usage}( tOptions* pOptions, int exitCode )
@end example

@item gnu-usage
@vindex gnu-usage
Normally, the default format produced by the @code{optionUsage} procedure
is @i{AutoOpts Standard}.  By specifying this attribute, the default format
will be @i{GNU-ish style}.  Either default may be overridden by the user with
the @code{AUTOOPTS_USAGE} environment variable.  If it is set to @code{gnu}
or @code{autoopts}, it will alter the style appropriately.  This attribute
will conflict with the @code{usage} attribute.

@item reorder-args
@vindex reorder-args
Some applications traditionally require that the command operands be
intermixed with the command options.  In order to handle that, the arguments
must be reordered.  If you are writing such an application, specify this
global option.  All of the options (and any associated option arguments)
will be brought to the beginning of the argument list.  New applications
should not use this feature, if at all possible.  This feature is
@i{disabled} if @code{POSIXLY_CORRECT} is defined in the environment.

@node option attributes
@subsection Option Attributes
@cindex option attributes

For each option you wish to specify, you must have a block macro named
@code{flag} defined.  There are two required attributes: @code{name} and
@code{descrip}.  If any options do not have a @code{value} (traditional flag
character) attribute, then the @code{long-opts} program attribute must also
be defined.  As a special exception, if no options have a @code{value}
@strong{and} @code{long-opts} is not defined @strong{and} @code{argument} is
not defined, then all arguments to the program are named options.  In this
case, the @code{-} and @code{--} command line option markers are optional.

@node Required Attributes
@subsubsection Required Attributes
@cindex Required Attributes

Every option must have exactly one copy of both of these attributes.

@table @samp
@item name
@vindex name
Long name for the option.  Even if you are not accepting long options
and are only accepting flags, it must be provided.  AutoOpts generates
private, named storage that requires this name.  This name also causes
a @code{#define}-d name to be emitted.  It must not conflict with any
other names you may be using in your program.

For example, if your option name is, @code{debug} or @code{munged-up},
you must not use the @code{#define} names @code{DEBUG} (or
@code{MUNGED_UP}) in your program for non-AutoOpts related purposes.
They are now used by AutoOpts.

Sometimes (most especially under Windows), you may get a surprise.
For example, @code{INTERFACE} is apparently a user space name that
one should be free to use.  Windows usurps this name.  To solve this,
you must do one of the following:

@enumerate
@item
Change the name of your option
@item
add the program attribute (@pxref{program attributes}):

@example
export = '#undef INTERFACE';
@end example
@item
add the program attribute:

@example
guard-option-names;
@end example
@end enumerate

@item descrip
@vindex descrip
Except for documentation options, a @strong{very} brief description of
the option.  About 40 characters on one line, maximum.  It appears on
the @code{usage()} output next to the option name.  If, however, the
option is a documentation option, it will appear on one or more lines by
itself.  It is thus used to visually separate and comment upon groups of
options in the usage text.
@end table

@node Common Attributes
@subsubsection Common Option Attributes
@cindex Common Option Attributes

These option attributes are optional.  Any that do appear in the
definition of a flag, may appear only once.

@table @samp
@item value
@vindex value
The flag character to specify for traditional option flags, e.g., @code{-L}.

@item max
@vindex max
Maximum occurrence count (invalid if @var{disable} present).
The default maximum is 1.  @code{NOLIMIT} can be used for the value,
otherwise it must be a number or a @code{#define} that evaluates to a number.

@item min
@vindex min
Minimum occurrence count.  If present, then the option @strong{must}
appear on the command line.  Do not define it with the value zero (0).

@item must-set
@vindex must-set
If an option must be specified, but it need not be specified on
the command line, then specify this attribute for the option.

@item deprecated
@vindex deprecated
There are two effects to this attribute:  the usage text will not
show the option, and the generated documentation will mark it with:
``@strong{NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED}''.

@item disable
@vindex disable
Prefix for disabling (inverting sense of) the option.  Only useful
if long option names are being processed.

@item enable
@vindex enable
Long-name prefix for enabling the option (invalid if @var{disable}
@strong{not} present).  Only useful if long option names are being
processed.

@item enabled
@vindex enabled
If default is for option being enabled.  (Otherwise, the OPTST_DISABLED
bit is set at compile time.)  Only useful if the option can be disabled.

@item ifdef
@itemx ifndef
@itemx omitted-usage
@vindex ifdef
@vindex ifndef
@vindex omitted-usage
If an option is relevant on certain platforms or when certain features
are enabled or disabled, you can specify the compile time flag used
to indicate when the option should be compiled in or out.  For example,
if you have a configurable feature, @code{mumble} that is indicated
with the compile time define, @code{WITH_MUMBLING}, then add:

@example
ifdef = WITH_MUMBLING;
@end example

@noindent
Take care when using these.  There are several caveats:
@itemize @bullet
@item
The case and spelling must match whatever is specified.
@item
Do not confuse these attributes with the AutoGen directives of the
same names, @xref{Directives}.  These cause C preprocessing directives
to be inserted into the generated C text.
@item
Only one of these attributes may apply to any given option.
@item
The @code{VALUE_OPT_} values are @code{#define}-d.  If @code{WITH_MUMBLING}
is not defined, then the associated @code{VALUE_OPT_} value will not be
@code{#define}-d either.  So, if you have an option named, @code{MUMBLING}
that is active only if @code{WITH_MUMBLING} is @code{#define}-d, then
@code{VALUE_OPT_MUMBLING} will be @code{#define}-d iff @code{WITH_MUMBLING}
is @code{#define}-d.  Watch those switch statements.
@item
If you specify @code{omitted-usage}, then the option will be recognized
as disabled when it is configured out of the build, but will yield the
message, ``This option has been disabled.''
@end itemize

@item no-command
@vindex no-command
This option specifies that the option is not allowed on the command line.
Such an option may not take a @code{value} (flag character) attribute.
The program must have the @code{homerc} (@pxref{program attributes}) option set.
@end table

@node opt-attr settable
@subsubsection Program may set option
@vindex settable
If the option can be set outside of option processing, specify
``@code{settable}''.  If this attribute is defined, special macros for setting
this particular option will be inserted into the interface file.  For example,
@code{TEMPL_DIRS} is a settable option for AutoGen, so a macro named
@code{SET_OPT_TEMPL_DIRS(a)} appears in the interface file.  This attribute
interacts with the @var{documentation} attribute.

@node opt-attr no-preset
@subsubsection Option cannot be pre-configured
@vindex no-preset
@cindex configuration file
If presetting this option is not allowed, specify ``@code{no-preset}''.
(Thus, environment variables and values set in configuration files will be
ignored.)

@node opt-attr equivalence
@subsubsection Option Equivalence Class
@vindex equivalence
Generally, when several options are mutually exclusive and basically serve the
purpose of selecting one of several processing modes, specify the
``@code{equivalence}'' attribute.  These options will be considered an
equivalence class.  Sometimes, it is just easier to deal with them as such.
All members of the equivalence class must contain the same equivalenced-to
option, including the equivalenced-to option itself.  Thus, it must be a class
member.

For an option equivalence class, there is a single occurrence counter for
the class.  It can be referenced with the interface macro,
@code{COUNT_OPT(BASE_OPTION)}, where ``BASE_OPTION'' is the equivalenced-to
option name.

Also, please take careful note: since the options are mapped to the
equivalenced-to option descriptor, any option argument values are mapped to
that descriptor also.  Be sure you know which ``equivalent option'' was
selected before getting an option argument value!

During the presetting phase of option processing (@pxref{Presetting
Options}), equivalenced options may be specified.  However, if different
equivalenced members are specified, only the last instance will be
recognized and the others will be discarded.  A conflict error is indicated
only when multiple different members appear on the command line itself.

As an example of where equivalenced options might be useful, @code{cpio(1)}
has three options @code{-o}, @code{-i}, and @code{-p} that define the
operational mode of the program (@code{create}, @code{extract} and
@code{pass-through}, respectively).  They form an equivalence class from
which one and only one member must appear on the command line.  If
@code{cpio} were an AutoOpt-ed program, then each of these option
definitions would contain:

@example
equivalence = create;
@end example

and the program would be able to determine the operating mode
with code that worked something like this:

@example
switch (WHICH_IDX_CREATE) @{
case INDEX_OPT_CREATE:       ...
case INDEX_OPT_EXTRACT:      ...
case INDEX_OPT_PASS_THROUGH: ...
default:    /* cannot happen */
@}
@end example

@node opt-attr default option
@subsubsection Default Option
@vindex default
If your program processes its arguments in named option mode (See
``long-opts'' in @ref{program attributes}), then you may select @strong{one}
of your options to be the default option.  Do so by using attribute
``@code{default}'' with one of the options.  The option so specified must have
an @code{arg-type} (@pxref{Option Arguments}) specified, but not the
@code{arg-optional} (@pxref{arg-optional}) attribute.  That is to say, the
option argument must be required.

If you have done this, then any arguments that do not match an option
name and do not contain an equal sign (@code{=}) will be interpreted as
an option argument to the default option.

@node opt-attr documentation
@subsubsection Option Sectioning Comment
This attribute means the option exists for the purpose of separating
option description text in the usage output.  Libraries may choose
to make it settable so that the library can determine which command
line option is the first one that pertains to the library.

@vindex documentation
If the ``@code{documentation}'' attribute is present, then all other
attributes are disabled except @code{settable}, @code{call-proc} and
@code{flag-code}.  @code{settable} must be and is only specified if
@code{call-proc}, @code{extract-code} or @code{flag-code} has been specified.
When present, the @code{descrip} attribute will be displayed only when the
@code{--help} option has been specified.  It will be displayed flush to the
left hand margin and may consist of one or more lines of text.  The name of
the option will not be printed.

Documentation options are for clarifying the usage text and will not
appear in generated man pages or in the generated invoking texinfo doc.

@node opt-attr translators
@subsubsection Translator Notes
@vindex translators
If you need to give the translators a special note about a particular option,
please use the ``@code{translators}'' attribute.  The attribute text will be
emitted into the generated @code{.c} text where the option related strings get
defined.  To make a general comment about all of the option code, add comments
to an @code{include} attribute (@pxref{program attributes}).  Do @strong{not}
use this attribute globally, or it will get emitted into every option
definition block.

@node Immediate Action
@subsubsection Immediate Action Attributes
@cindex immediate action

Certain options may need to be processed early.  For example, in order to
suppress the processing of configuration files, it is necessary to process the
command line option @code{--no-load-opts} @strong{before} the config files are
processed.  To accommodate this, certain options may have their enabled or
disabled forms marked for immediate processing.  The consequence of this is
that they are processed ahead of all other options in the reverse of normal
order.

Normally, the first options processed are the options specified in the first
@code{homerc} file, followed by then next @code{homerc} file through to the
end of config file processing.  Next, environment variables are processed and
finally, the command line options.  The later options override settings
processed earlier.  That actually gives them higher priority.  Command line
immediate action options actually have the lowest priority of all.  They would
be used only if they are to have an effect on the processing of subsequent
options.

@table @samp
@item immediate
@vindex immediate
Use this option attribute to specify that the enabled form of the option
is to be processed immediately.  The @code{help} and @code{more-help}
options are so specified.  They will also call @code{exit()} upon
completion, so they @strong{do} have an effect on the processing
of the remaining options :-).

@item immed-disable
@vindex immed-disable
Use this option attribute to specify that the disabled form of the
option is to be processed immediately.  The @code{load-opts} option is
so specified.  The @code{--no-load-opts} command line option will
suppress the processing of config files and environment variables.
Contrariwise, the @code{--load-opts} command line option is
processed normally.  That means that the options specified in that file
will be processed after all the @code{homerc} files and, in fact, after
options that precede it on the command line.

@item also
If either the @code{immediate} or the @code{immed-disable} attributes
are set to the string, ``@code{also}'', then the option will actually be
processed twice:  first at the immediate processing phase and again
at the ``normal'' time.
@end table

@node Option Conflict Attributes
@subsubsection Option Conflict Attributes
@cindex Option Conflict Attributes

These attributes may be used as many times as you need.
They are used at the end of the option processing to verify
that the context within which each option is found does not
conflict with the presence or absence of other options.

This is not a complete cover of all possible conflicts and
requirements, but it simple to implement and covers the
more common situations.

@table @samp
@cindex flags-must
@item flags-must
one entry for every option that @strong{must} be present
when this option is present

@cindex flags-cant
@item flags-cant
one entry for every option that @strong{cannot} be present
when this option is present
@end table

@node Option Arguments
@subsection Option Argument Specification
@cindex Option Arguments

Command line options come in three flavors:  options that do not
take arguments, those that do and those that may.  Without an
"arg-type" attribute, AutoOpts will not process an argument to an
option.  If "arg-type" is specified and "arg-optional" is also
specified, then the next command line token will be taken to
be an argument, unless it looks like the name of another option.

If the argument type is specified to be anything other than "str[ing]", then
AutoOpts will specify a callback procedure to handle the argument.  Some of
these procedures will be created and inserted into the generated @code{.c}
file, and others are already built into the @file{libopts} library.
Therefore, if you write your own callback procedure
(@pxref{Option Argument Handling}), then you must either not specify an
"arg-type" attribute, or else specify it to be of type "str[ing]".  Your
callback function will be able to place its own restrictions on what that
string may contain or represent.

Option argument handling attributes depend upon the value set for the
@vindex arg-type
@code{arg-type} attribute.  It specifies the type of argument the option
will take.  If not present, the option cannot take an argument.  If present,
it must be an entry in the following table.  The first three letters is
sufficient.

@menu
* arg-type string::         Arg Type String
* arg-type number::         Arg Type Number
* arg-type boolean::        Arg Type Boolean
* arg-type keyword::        Arg Type Keyword
* arg-type set membership:: Arg Type Set Membership
* arg-type hierarchy::      Arg Type Hierarchical
* arg-type file name::      Arg Type File Name
* arg-type time::           Arg Type Time Duration

Supporting attributes for particular argument types:

* arg-keyword::             Keyword list
* arg-optional::            Option Argument Optional
* arg-default::             Default Option Argument Value
@end menu

@node arg-keyword
@subsubsection Keyword list
@vindex keyword
If the @code{arg-type} is @code{keyword} (@pxref{arg-type keyword}) or
@code{set-membership} (@pxref{arg-type set membership}), then you must specify
the list of keywords by a series of @code{keyword} entries.  The interface
file will contain values for @code{@i{<OPTN_NAME>}_@i{<KEYWORD>}} for each
keyword entry.  @code{keyword} option types will have an enumeration and
@code{set-membership} option types will have a set of unsigned bits
@code{#define}-d.

If the @code{arg-type} is specifically @code{keyword}, you may also add
special handling code with a
@vindex extra-code
@code{extra-code} attribute.  After @code{optionEnumerationVal} has
converted the input string into an enumeration, you may insert code to
process this enumeration value (@code{pOptDesc->optArg.argEnum}).

@node arg-optional
@subsubsection Option Argument Optional
@vindex arg-optional
This attribute indicates that the user does not have to supply an argument for
the option.  This is only valid if the @var{arg-type} is @code{string}
(@pxref{arg-type string}) or @code{keyword} (@pxref{arg-type keyword}).  If it
is @code{keyword}, then this attribute may also specify the default keyword to
assume when the argument is not supplied.  If left empty, @var{arg-default}
(@pxref{arg-default}) or the zero-valued keyword will be used.

This is overridden and the options are required if the libopts library
gets configured with @code{--disable-optional-args}.


@node arg-default
@subsubsection Default Option Argument Value
@vindex arg-default
This specifies the default option argument value to be used when the option is
not specified or preset.  You may specify multiple @code{arg-default} values if
the argument type is @code{set membership}.

@node arg-type string
@subsubsection Arg Type String
@code{arg-type = string;}

The argument may be any arbitrary string, though your program or option
callback procedure may place additional constraints upon it.


@node arg-type number
@subsubsection Arg Type Number
@code{arg-type = number;}

The argument must be a correctly formed integer, without any trailing U's or
L's.  AutoOpts contains a library procedure to convert the string to a number.
If you specify range checking with @code{arg-range} (see below), then AutoOpts
produces a special purpose procedure for this option.

@table @samp
@item scaled
@vindex scaled
@code{scaled} marks the option so that suffixes of @samp{k}, @samp{K},
@samp{m}, @samp{M}, @samp{g}, @samp{G}, @samp{t}, and @samp{T} will multiply
the given number by a power of 1000 or 1024.  Lower case letters scale by a
power of 1000 and upper case scale by a power of 1024.

@item arg-range
@vindex arg-range
@code{arg-range} is used to create a callback procedure for validating the
range of the option argument.  It must match one of the range entries.  Each
@code{arg-range} should consist of either an integer by itself or an integer
range.  The integer range is specified by one or two integers separated by the
two character sequence, @code{->}.  Be sure to quote the entire range string.
The definitions parser will not accept the range syntax as a single string
token.

The generated procedure imposes the range constraints as follows:
@itemize @bullet
@item
A number by itself will match that one value.
@item
The high end of the range may not be @code{INT_MIN}, both for obvious
reasons and because that value is used to indicate a single-valued match.
@item
An omitted lower value implies a lower bound of INT_MIN.
@item
An omitted upper value implies a upper bound of INT_MAX.
@item
The argument value is required.  It may not be optional.
@item
The value must match one of the entries.  If it can match more than one,
then you have redundancies, but no harm will come of it.
@end itemize
@end table


@node arg-type boolean
@subsubsection Arg Type Boolean
@code{arg-type = boolean;}

The argument will be interpreted and always yield either AG_TRUE or
AG_FALSE.  False values are@:  the empty string, the number zero, or a
string that starts with @code{f}, @code{F}, @code{n} or @code{N}
(representing False or No).  Anything else will be interpreted as True.


@node arg-type keyword
@subsubsection Arg Type Keyword
@code{arg-type = keyword;}

The argument must match a specified list of strings (@pxref{arg-keyword}).
Assuming you have named the option, @code{optn-name}, the strings will be
converted into an enumeration of type @code{te_Optn_Name} with the values
@code{OPTN_NAME_KEYWORD}.*  If you have @strong{not} specified a default value,
the value @code{OPTN_NAME_UNDEFINED} will be inserted with the value zero.
The option will be initialized to that value.  You may now use this in your
code as follows:

@example
te_Optn_Name opt = OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME;
switch (opt) @{
case OPTN_NAME_UNDEFINED:  /* undefined things */ break;
case OPTN_NAME_KEYWORD:    /* `keyword' things */ break;
default: /* utterly impossible */ ;
@}
@end example

AutoOpts produces a special purpose procedure for this option.

If you have need for the string name of the selected keyword, you
may obtain this with the macro, @code{OPT_OPTN_NAME_VAL2STR(val)}.
The value you pass would normally be @code{OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME},
but anything with numeric value that is legal for @code{te_Optn_Name}
may be passed.  Anything out of range will result in the string,
@code{"*INVALID*"} being returned.  The strings are read only.
It may be used as in:

@example
te_Optn_Name opt = OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME;
printf( "you selected the %s keyword\n",
        OPT_OPTN_NAME_VAL2STR(opt) );
@end example

* Note: you may replace the @code{OPTN_NAME} enumeration prefix with
another prefix by specifying a
@vindex prefix-enum
@code{prefix-enum} attribute.

@node arg-type set membership
@subsubsection Arg Type Set Membership
@code{arg-type = set;}

The argument must be a list of names each of which must match the strings
"@code{all}", "@code{none}" or one of the keywords (@pxref{arg-keyword})
specified for this option.  @code{all} will turn on all membership bits and
@code{none} will turn them all off.  Specifying one of the keywords will turn
on the corresponding set membership bit.  Literal numbers may also be used and
may, thereby, set or clear more than one bit.  Preceding a keyword or literal
number with a bang (@code{!}  - exclamation point) will turn the bit(s) off.
The number of keywords allowed is constrained by the number of bits in a
pointer, as the bit set is kept in a @code{void*}.

If, for example, you specified @code{first} in your list of keywords,
then you can use the following code to test to see if either @code{first}
or @code{all} was specified:

@example
uintptr_t opt = OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME;
if (opt & OPTN_NAME_FIRST)
    /* OPTN_NAME_FIRST bit was set */ ;
@end example

AutoOpts produces a special purpose procedure for this option.
To set multiple bits as the default (initial) value, you must
specify an initial numeric value (which might become inaccurate over
time), or else specify @code{arg-default} multiple times.  Do not
specify a series of names conjoined with @code{+} symbols as the
value for any of the @code{arg-default} attributes.  That works for
option parsing, but not for the option code generation.

@node arg-type hierarchy
@subsubsection Arg Type Hierarchical
@code{arg-type = hierarchy;}
@*
@code{arg-type = nested;}

This denotes an option with a structure-valued argument, a.k.a.
``subopts'' in @code{getopts} terminology.  The argument is parsed
and the values made available to the program via the find and
find next calls (@xref{libopts-optionFindValue},
@xref{libopts-optionGetValue}, and
@pxref{libopts-optionFindNextValue}).

@example
tOptionValue * val = optionGetValue(VALUE_OPT_OPTN_NAME, "name");
while (val != NULL) @{
  process(val);
  val = optionNextValue(VALUE_OPT_OPTN_NAME, val);
  if (wrong_name(val, "name"))
    break;
@}
@end example


@node arg-type file name
@subsubsection Arg Type File Name
@code{arg-type = file;}

This argument type will have some validations on the argument and,
optionally, actually open the file.  You must specify several additonal
attributes for the option:

@table @samp
@item file-exists
@vindex file-exists
If not specified or empty, then the directory portion of the name is checked.
The directory must exist or the argument is rejected and the usage procedure
is invoked.

Otherwise, both the directory as above and the full name is tested for
existence.  If the value begins with the two letters ``no'', then the file
must not pre-exist.  Otherwise, the file is expected to exist.

@item open-file
@vindex open-file
If not specified or empty, the file is left alone.
If the value begins with the four letters ``desc''[@i{riptor}], then
@code{open(2)} is used and @code{optArg.argFd} is set.  Otherwise, the
file is opened with @code{fopen} and @code{optArg.argFp} is set.

@item file-mode
@vindex file-mode
If ``open-file'' is set and not empty, then you must specify the open mode.
Set the value to the flag bits or mode string as appropriate for the open
type.
@end table


@node arg-type time
@subsubsection Arg Type Time Duration
@code{arg-type = time;}

The argument will be converted into a number of seconds.  It may be
a multi-part number with different parts being multiplied into a seconds
value and added into the final result.  Valid forms are in the table
below.  Upper cased letters represent numbers that must be used in the
expressions.

@table @samp
@item [[HH:]MM:]SS
where the hyphens (@code{-}) are really colons(@code{:}), but the
texi doc system won't allow colons there.

@code{HH} is multiplied by @code{3600} and @code{MM} multiplied by @code{60}
before they are added to @code{SS}.  This time specification may not be
followed by any other time specs.  @code{HH} and @code{MM} are both optional,
though @code{HH} cannot be specified without @code{MM}.

@item DAYS d
@code{DAYS} is multiplied by the number of seconds in a day.  This value may
be followed by (and added to) values specified by @code{HH:MM:SS} or the
suffixed values below.  If present, it must always be first.

@item HRS h
@code{HRS} is multiplied by the number of seconds in an hour.  This value may
be followed by (and added to) values specified by @code{MM:SS} or the
suffixed values below.

@item MINS m
@code{MINS} is multiplied by the number of seconds in a minute.  This value may
be followed by (and added to) a count of seconds.

@item SECS s
This value can only be the last value in a time specification.  The @code{s}
suffix is optional.
@end table

@example
   5 d 1:10:05    ==> 5 days + 1 hour 10 minutes and 5 seconds
   5 d 1 h 10 m 5 ==> yields: 436205 seconds
   5d1h10m5s      ==> same result -- spaces are optional.
@end example

When saved into a config file, the value will be stored as a simple count
of seconds.  There are actually more (many) accepted time duration strings.
The full documentation can be found with ISO-8601 documentation and the
more extedded documentation when ``parse_duration()'' becomes more widely
available.


@node Option Argument Handling
@subsection Option Argument Handling
@cindex Option Argument Handling

AutoOpts will either specify or automatically generate callback procedures
for options that take specialized arguments.  The only option argument types
that are not specialized are plain string arguments and no argument at all.
For options that fall into one of those two categories, you may specify your
own callback function, as specified below.  If you do this and if you
specify that options are resettable (@pxref{automatic options}), then your
option handling code @strong{must} look for the @code{OPTST_RESET} bit in
the @code{fOptState} field of the option descriptor.

If the option takes a string argument, then you may specify that the option
is to be handled by the @code{libopts} library procedures
@code{stackOptArg()} or @code{unstackOptArg()} (see below).  In this case,
you may not provide option handling code.

Finally, @code{documentation} options (@pxref{opt-attr documentation}) may
also be marked as @code{settable} (@pxref{opt-attr settable}) and have special
callback functions (either @code{flag-code}, @code{extract-code}, or
@code{call-proc}).

@table @samp
@item flag-code
@vindex flag-code
statements to execute when the option is encountered.
The generated procedure will look like this:

@example
static void
doOpt<name>( tOptions* pOptions, tOptDesc* pOptDesc )
@{
<flag-code>
@}
@end example

Only certain fields within the @code{tOptions} and @code{tOptDesc}
structures may be accessed.  @xref{Option Processing Data}.

@item extract-code
@vindex extract-code
This is effectively identical to @code{flag-code}, except that the
source is kept in the output file instead of the definitions file.
A long comment is used to demarcate the code.  You must not modify
that marker.  @i{Before} regenerating the option code file,
the old file is renamed from MUMBLE.c to MUMBLE.c.save.  The template
will be looking there for the text to copy into the new output file.

@item call-proc
@vindex call-proc
external procedure to call when option is encountered.  The calling
sequence must conform to the sequence defined above for the generated
procedure, @code{doOpt<name>}.  It has the same restrictions
regarding the fields within the structures passed in as arguments.
@xref{Option Processing Data}.

@item flag-proc
@vindex flag-proc
Name of another option whose @code{flag-code} can be executed
when this option is encountered.

@item stack-arg
@vindex stack-arg
Call a special library routine to stack the option's arguments.  Special
macros in the interface file are provided for determining how many of the
options were found (@code{STACKCT_OPT(NAME)}) and to obtain a pointer to a
list of pointers to the argument values (@code{STACKLST_OPT(NAME)}).
Obviously, for a stackable argument, the @code{max} attribute
(@pxref{Common Attributes}) needs to be set higher than @code{1}.

If this stacked argument option has a disablement prefix, then the entire
stack of arguments will be cleared by specifying the option with that
disablement prefix.

@item unstack-arg
@vindex unstack-arg
Call a special library routine to remove (``unstack'') strings
from a @code{stack-arg} option stack.  This attribute must name
the option that is to be ``unstacked''.  Neither this option nor
the stacked argument option it references may be equivalenced to
another option.
@end table

@node Internationalizing Options
@subsection Internationalizing Options
@cindex Internationalizing Options

Normally, AutoOpts produces usage text that is difficult to translate.  It is
pieced together on the fly using words and phrases scattered around here and
there, piecing together toe document.  This does not translate well.

Incorporated into this package are some ways around the problem.  First, you
should specify the @code{full-usage} and @code{short-usage} program attributes
(@pxref{program attributes}).  This will enable your translators to translate
the usage text as a whole.

Your translators will also be able to translate long option names.  The option
name translations will then become the names searched for both on the command
line and in configuration files.  However, it will not affect the names of
environment variable names used to configure your program.

If it is considered desireable to keep configuration files in the ``C''
locale, then several macros are available to suppress or delay the
translations of option names at run time.  These are all disabled if
@code{ENABLE_NLS} is not defined at compile time.  These macros @strong{must}
be invoked before the first invocation of @code{optionProcess}.

@table @samp
@item  OPT_NO_XLAT_CFG_NAMES;
@itemx OPT_XLAT_CFG_NAMES;
Disable (or enable) the translations of option names for configuration files.
If you enable translation for config files, then they will be translated for
command line options.

@item  OPT_NO_XLAT_OPT_NAMES;
@itemx OPT_XLAT_OPT_NAMES;
Disable (or enable) the translations of option names for command line
processing.  If you disable the translation for command line processing,
you will also disable it for configuration file processing.  Once translated,
the option names will remain translated.
@end table

@node documentation attributes
@subsection Man and Info doc Attributes
@cindex documentation attributes

AutoOpts includes AutoGen templates for producing abbreviated man pages
and for producing the invoking section of an info document.  To take
advantage of these templates, you must add several attributes to your
option definitions.

@table @samp
@item arg-name
@vindex arg-name
If an option has an argument, the argument should have a name for
documentation purposes.  It will default to @code{arg-type}, but
it will likely be clearer with something else like, @code{file-name}
instead of @code{string} (the type).

@item doc
@vindex doc
First, every @code{flag} definition @emph{other than} ``documentation''
definitions, must have a @code{doc} attribute defined.  If the option takes
an argument, then it will need an @code{arg-name} attribute as well.  The
@code{doc} text should be in plain sentences with minimal formatting.  The
Texinfo commands @code{@@code}, and @code{@@var} will have its enclosed text
made into @strong{\fB} entries in the man page, and the @code{@@file} text
will be made into @strong{\fI} entries.  The @code{arg-name} attribute is
used to display the option's argument in the man page.

Options marked with the ``documentation'' attribute are for documenting
the usage text.  All other options should have the ``doc'' attribute in
order to document the usage of the option in the generated man pages.

@item man-doc
@vindex man-doc
Finally, if you need to add man page sections like @code{SEE ALSO} or
@code{USAGE} or other, put that text in a @code{man-doc} definition.  This
text will be inserted verbatim in the man page after the @code{OPTIONS}
section and before the @code{AUTHOR} section.

@item option-info
@vindex option-info
This text will be inserted as a lead-in paragraph in the @code{OPTIONS}
section of the generated man page.

@item prog-man-descrip
@itemx prog-info-descrip
@vindex prog-man-descrip
@vindex prog-info-descrip
Then, you need to supply a brief description of what your program does.
If you already have a @code{detail} definition, this may be sufficient.
If not, or if you need special formatting for one of the manual formats,
then you will need either a definition for @code{prog-man-descrip} or
@code{prog-info-descrip} or both.  These will be inserted verbatim
in the man page document and the info document, respectively.
@end table

@node automatic options
@subsection Automatically Supported Options
@cindex automatic options

AutoOpts provides automated support for several options.  @code{help} and
@code{more-help} are always provided.  The others are conditional upon
various global program attributes being defined @xref{program attributes}.

Below are the option names and default flag values.  The flags are activated
if and only if at least one user-defined option also uses a flag value.  The
long names are supported as option names if @code{long-opts} has been
specified.  These option flags may be deleted or changed to characters of your
choosing by specifying
@vindex more-help-value
@vindex usage-value
@vindex version-value
@vindex load-opts-value
@vindex reset-value
@code{xxx-value = "y";}, where @code{xxx} is one of the
option names below and @code{y} is either empty or the character of your choice.
For example, to change the help flag from @code{?} to @code{h}, specify
@vindex help-value
@code{help-value = "h";}; and to require that @code{save-opts} be specified
only with its long option name, specify
@vindex save-opts-value
@code{save-opts-value = "";}.

With the exception of the @code{load-opts} option, none of these automatically
supported options will be recognized in configuration files or environment
variables.

@table @samp
@item help -?
This option will immediately invoke the @code{USAGE()} procedure
and display the usage line, a description of each option with
its description and option usage information.  This is followed
by the contents of the definition of the @code{detail} text macro.

@item more-help -!
This option is identical to the @code{help} option, except that the
output is passed through a pager program.  (@code{more} by default, or
the program identified by the @code{PAGER} environment variable.)

@item usage -u
This option must be requested by specifying, @code{usage-opt} in the option
definition file.  It will produce abbreviated help text to @file{stdout} and
exit with zero status (@code{EXIT_SUCCESS}).

@item version -v
This will print the program name, title and version.  If it is followed by
the letter @code{c} and a value for @code{copyright} and @code{owner} have
been provided, then the copyright will be printed, too.  If it is followed
by the letter @code{n}, then the full copyright notice (if available) will
be printed.  The @code{version} attribute must be specified in the option
definition file.

@item load-opts -<
@cindex configuration file
This option will load options from the named file.  They will be treated
exactly as if they were loaded from the normally found configuration files,
but will not be loaded until the option is actually processed.  This can also
be used within another configuration file, causing them to nest.  This is the
@strong{only} automatically supported option that can be activated inside of
config files or with environment variables.

Specifying the negated form of the option (@code{--no-load-opts}) will
suppress the processing of configuration files and environment variables.

This option is activated by specifying one or more @code{homerc} attributes.

@item save-opts ->
@cindex configuration file
This option will cause the option state to be printed in the configuration file
format when option processing is done but not yet verified for consistency.
The program will terminate successfully without running when this has
completed.  Note that for most shells you will have to quote or escape the
flag character to restrict special meanings to the shell.

The output file will be the configuration file name (default or provided by
@code{rcfile}) in the last directory named in a @code{homerc} definition.

This option may be set from within your program by invoking the
"@code{SET_OPT_SAVE_OPTS(@i{filename})}" macro (@pxref{SET_OPT_name}).
Invoking this macro will set the file name for saving the option processing
state, but the state will @strong{not} actually be saved.  You must call
@code{optionSaveFile} to do that (@pxref{libopts-optionSaveFile}).
@strong{CAVEAT:} if, after invoking this macro, you call
@code{optionProcess}, the option processing state will be saved to this file
and @code{optionProcess} will not return.  You may wish to invoke
@code{CLEAR_OPT( SAVE_OPTS )} (@pxref{CLEAR_OPT}) beforehand if you do need
to reinvoke @code{optionProcess}.

This option is activated by specifying one or more @code{homerc} attributes.

@item reset-option -R
This option is enabled by setting the global program attribute,
@code{resettable}.  This option takes the name of an option for the current
program and resets its state such that it is set back to its original,
compile-time initialized value.  If the option state is subsequently stored
(via @code{--save-opts}), the named option will not appear in that file.

This option is activated by specifying the @code{resettable} attribute.

@strong{BEWARE}:  If the @code{resettable} attribute is specified, all
option callbacks @strong{must} look for the @code{OPTST_RESET} bit in the
@code{fOptState} field of the option descriptor.  If set, the @code{optCookie}
and @code{optArg} fields will be unchanged from their last setting.  When the
callback returns, these fields will be set to their original values.  If you
use this feature and you have allocated data hanging off of the cookie, you
need to deallocate it.
@end table

@node standard options
@subsection Library of Standard Options
@cindex standard options

AutoOpts has developed a set of standardized options.
You may incorporate these options in your program simply by @emph{first}
adding a @code{#define} for the options you want, and then the line,

@example
#include stdoptions.def
@end example

@noindent
in your option definitions.  The supported options are specified thus:

@example
#define DEBUG
#define DIRECTORY
#define DRY_RUN
#define INPUT
#define INTERACTIVE
#define OUTPUT
#define WARN

#define SILENT
#define QUIET
#define BRIEF
#define VERBOSE
@end example

By default, only the long form of the option will be available.
To specify the short (flag) form, suffix these names with @code{_FLAG}.
e.g.,

@example
#define DEBUG_FLAG
@end example

@code{--silent}, @code{--quiet}, @code{--brief} and @code{--verbose} are
related in that they all indicate some level of diagnostic output.
These options are all designed to conflict with each other.
Instead of four different options, however, several levels can be
incorporated by @code{#define}-ing @code{VERBOSE_ENUM}.  In conjunction
with @code{VERBOSE}, it incorporates the notion of @i{5} levels in an
enumeration: @code{silent}, @code{quiet}, @code{brief},
@code{informative} and @code{verbose}; with the default being
@code{brief}.

@node Option Processing Data
@subsection Data for Option Processing
@cindex Option Processing Data

This section describes the data that may be accessed from within the
option processing callback routines.  The following fields may be used
in the following ways and may be used for read only.  The first set is
addressed from the @code{tOptDesc*} pointer:

@table @samp
@cindex optIndex
@item optIndex
@cindex optValue
@item optValue
These may be used by option procedures to determine which option they
are working on (in case they handle several options).

@cindex optActualIndex
@item optActualIndex
@cindex optActualValue
@item optActualValue
These may be used by option procedures to determine which option was
used to set the current option.  This may be different from the above if
the options are members of an equivalence class.

@cindex optOccCt
@item optOccCt
If AutoOpts is processing command line arguments, then this value will
contain the current occurrence count.  During the option preset phase
(reading configuration files and examining environment variables), the value is
zero.

@cindex fOptState
@item fOptState
The field may be tested for the following bit values
(prefix each name with @code{OPTST_}, e.g. @code{OPTST_INIT}):

@table @samp
@item INIT
Initial compiled value.  As a bit test, it will always yield FALSE.

@item SET
The option was set via the @code{SET_OPT()} macro.

@item PRESET
@cindex configuration file
The option was set via a configuration file.

@item DEFINED
The option was set via a command line option.

@item SET_MASK
This is a mask of flags that show the set state, one of the
above four values.

@item EQUIVALENCE
This bit is set when the option was selected by an equivalenced option.

@item DISABLED
This bit is set if the option is to be disabled.
(Meaning it was a long option prefixed by the disablement prefix, or
the option has not been specified yet and initializes as @code{disabled}.)
@end table

As an example of how this might be used, in AutoGen I want to allow
template writers to specify that the template output can be left
in a writable or read-only state.  To support this, there is a Guile
function named @code{set-writable} (@pxref{SCM set-writable}).
Also, I provide for command options @code{--writable} and
@code{--not-writable}.  I give precedence to command line and RC
file options, thus:

@example
switch (STATE_OPT( WRITABLE )) @{
case OPTST_DEFINED:
case OPTST_PRESET:
    fprintf( stderr, zOverrideWarn, pCurTemplate->pzFileName,
             pCurMacro->lineNo );
    break;

default:
    if (gh_boolean_p( set ) && (set == SCM_BOOL_F))
        CLEAR_OPT( WRITABLE );
    else
        SET_OPT_WRITABLE;
@}
@end example

@cindex pzLastArg
@item pzLastArg
Pointer to the latest argument string.  BEWARE@: If the argument type
is numeric, an enumeration or a bit mask, then this will be the
argument @strong{value} and not a pointer to a string.
@end table

The following two fields are addressed from the @code{tOptions*} pointer:

@table @samp
@cindex pzProgName
@item pzProgName
Points to a NUL-terminated string containing the current program
name, as retrieved from the argument vector.

@cindex pzProgPath
@item pzProgPath
Points to a NUL-terminated string containing the full path of
the current program, as retrieved from the argument vector.
(If available on your system.)

@end table

Note@:  these fields get filled in during the first call to
@code{optionProcess()}.  All other fields are private, for the exclusive
use of AutoOpts code and are subject to change.

@node CLEAR_OPT
@subsection CLEAR_OPT( <NAME> ) - Clear Option Markings
@findex CLEAR_OPT

Make as if the option had never been specified.
@code{HAVE_OPT(<NAME>)} will yield @code{FALSE}
after invoking this macro.

@node COUNT_OPT
@subsection COUNT_OPT( <NAME> ) - Definition Count
@findex COUNT_OPT

This macro will tell you how many times the option was
specified on the command line.  It does not include counts
of preset options.

@example
if (COUNT_OPT( NAME ) != desired-count) @{
    make-an-undesirable-message.
@}
@end example

@node DESC
@subsection DESC( <NAME> ) - Option Descriptor
@findex DESC

This macro is used internally by other AutoOpt macros.
It is not for general use.  It is used to obtain the option description
corresponding to its @strong{UPPER CASED} option name argument.
This is primarily used in other macro definitions.

@node DISABLE_OPT_name
@subsection DISABLE_OPT_name - Disable an option
@findex DISABLE_OPT_name

This macro is emitted if it is both settable
and it can be disabled.  If it cannot be disabled, it may
always be CLEAR-ed (see above).

The form of the macro will actually depend on whether the
option is equivalenced to another, and/or has an assigned
handler procedure.  Unlike the @code{SET_OPT} macro,
this macro does not allow an option argument.

@example
DISABLE_OPT_NAME;
@end example

@node ENABLED_OPT
@subsection ENABLED_OPT( <NAME> ) - Is Option Enabled?
@findex ENABLED_OPT

Yields true if the option defaults to disabled and
@code{ISUNUSED_OPT()} would yield true.  It also yields true if
the option has been specified with a disablement prefix,
disablement value or the @code{DISABLE_OPT_NAME} macro was invoked.

@node ERRSKIP_OPTERR
@subsection ERRSKIP_OPTERR - Ignore Option Errors
@findex ERRSKIP_OPTERR

When it is necessary to continue (return to caller)
on option errors, invoke this option.  It is reversible.
@xref{ERRSTOP_OPTERR}.

@node ERRSTOP_OPTERR
@subsection ERRSTOP_OPTERR - Stop on Errors
@findex ERRSTOP_OPTERR

After invoking this macro, if @code{optionProcess()}
encounters an error, it will call @code{exit(1)} rather than return.
This is the default processing mode.  It can be overridden by
specifying @code{allow-errors} in the definitions file,
or invoking the macro @xref{ERRSKIP_OPTERR}.

@node HAVE_OPT
@subsection HAVE_OPT( <NAME> ) - Have this option?
@findex HAVE_OPT

This macro yields true if the option has been specified
in any fashion at all.  It is used thus:

@example
if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) @{
    <do-things-associated-with-opt-name>;
@}
@end example

@node ISSEL_OPT
@subsection ISSEL_OPT( <NAME> ) - Is Option Selected?
@findex ISSEL_OPT

This macro yields true if the option has been
specified either on the command line or via a SET/DISABLE macro.

@node ISUNUSED_OPT
@subsection ISUNUSED_OPT( <NAME> ) - Never Specified?
@findex ISUNUSED_OPT

This macro yields true if the option has
never been specified, or has been cleared via the
@code{CLEAR_OPT()} macro.

@node OPTION_CT
@subsection OPTION_CT - Full Count of Options
@findex OPTION_CT

The full count of all options, both those defined
and those generated automatically by AutoOpts.  This is primarily
used to initialize the program option descriptor structure.

@node OPT_ARG
@subsection OPT_ARG( <NAME> ) - Option Argument String
@findex OPT_ARG

The option argument value as a pointer to string.  Note that argument
values that have been specified as numbers are stored as numbers or
keywords.  For such options, use instead the @code{OPT_VALUE_name}
define.  It is used thus:

@example
if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) @{
    char* p = OPT_ARG( NAME );
    <do-things-with-opt-name-argument-string>;
@}
@end example

@node OPT_NO_XLAT_CFG_NAMES
@subsection OPT_NO_XLAT_CFG_NAMES - option name xlation
@findex OPT_NO_XLAT_CFG_NAMES

Invoking this macro will disable the translation of option names only while
processing configuration files and environment variables.  This must be
invoked before the first call to @code{optionProcess}..  You need not invoke
this if your option definition file contains the attribute assignment,
``@code{no-xlate = opt-cfg;}''.

@node OPT_NO_XLAT_OPT_NAMES
@subsection OPT_NO_XLAT_OPT_NAMES - option name xlation
@findex OPT_NO_XLAT_OPT_NAMES

Invoking this macro will completely disable the translation of option names.
This must be invoked before the first call to @code{optionProcess}.  You need
not invoke this if your option definition file contains the attribute
assignment, ``@code{no-xlate = opt;}''.

@node OPT_VALUE_name
@subsection OPT_VALUE_name - Option Argument Value
@findex OPT_VALUE_name

This macro gets emitted only for options that take numeric, keyword or set
membership arguments.  The macro yields a word-sized integer containing the
enumeration, bit set or numeric value for the option argument.

@example
int opt_val = OPT_VALUE_name;
@end example

@node OPT_XLAT_CFG_NAMES
@subsection OPT_XLAT_CFG_NAMES - option name xlation
@findex OPT_XLAT_CFG_NAMES

If @code{ENABLE_NLS} is defined, this macro will cause the translation of
option names to happen before starting the processing of configuration files
and environment variables.  This will change the recognition of options within
the @code{$PROGRAMNAME} environment variable, but will not alter the names
used for setting options via @code{$PROGRAMNAME_name} environment variables.

This must be invoked before the first call to @code{optionProcess}.  You might
need to use this macro if your option definition file contains the attribute
assignment, ``@code{no-xlate = opt;}'' or ``@code{no-xlate = opt-cfg;}'', and
you have determined in some way that you wish to override that.

@node OPT_XLAT_OPT_NAMES
@subsection OPT_XLAT_OPT_NAMES - option name xlation
@findex OPT_XLAT_OPT_NAMES

If @code{ENABLE_NLS} is defined, translate the option names before processing
the command line options.  Long option names may thus be localized.
(If the names were translated before configuration processing, they will
not be re-translated.)

This must be invoked before the first call to @code{optionProcess}.  You might
need to use this macro if your option definition file contains the attribute
assignment, ``@code{no-xlate = opt;}'' and you have determined in some way that
you wish to override that.

@node RESTART_OPT
@subsection RESTART_OPT( n ) - Resume Option Processing
@findex RESTART_OPT

If option processing has stopped (either because of an error
or something was encountered that looked like a program argument),
it can be resumed by providing this macro with the index @code{n}
of the next option to process and calling @code{optionProcess()} again.

@node SET_OPT_name
@subsection SET_OPT_name - Force an option to be set
@findex SET_OPT_name

This macro gets emitted only when the given
option has the @code{settable} attribute specified.

The form of the macro will actually depend on whether the option is
equivalenced to another, has an option argument and/or has an assigned
handler procedure.  If the option has an argument, then this macro will
too.  Beware that the argument is not reallocated, so the value must not
be on the stack or deallocated in any other way for as long as the value
might get referenced.

If you have supplied at least one @file{homerc} file
(@pxref{program attributes}), this macro will be emitted for the
@code{--save-opts} option.

@node STACKCT_OPT
@subsection STACKCT_OPT( <NAME> ) - Stacked Arg Count
@findex STACKCT_OPT

When the option handling attribute is specified
as @code{stack_arg}, this macro may be used to determine how
many of them actually got stacked.

Do not use this on options that have not been stacked or has not been
specified (the @code{stack_arg} attribute must have been specified,
and @code{HAVE_OPT(<NAME>)} must yield TRUE).
Otherwise, you will likely seg fault.

@example
if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) @{
    int     ct = STACKCT_OPT(  NAME );
    char**  pp = STACKLST_OPT( NAME );

    do  @{
        char* p = *pp++;
        do-things-with-p;
    @} while (--ct > 0);
@}
@end example

@node STACKLST_OPT
@subsection STACKLST_OPT( <NAME> ) - Argument Stack
@findex STACKLST_OPT

The address of the list of pointers to the
option arguments.  The pointers are ordered by the order in
which they were encountered in the option presets and
command line processing.

Do not use this on options that have not been stacked or has not been
specified (the @code{stack_arg} attribute must have been specified,
and @code{HAVE_OPT(<OPTION>)} must yield TRUE).
Otherwise, you will likely seg fault.

@example
if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) @{
    int     ct = STACKCT_OPT(  NAME );
    char**  pp = STACKLST_OPT( NAME );

@findex START_OPT

This is just a shortcut for RESTART_OPT(1) (@xref{RESTART_OPT}.)

@node STATE_OPT
@subsection STATE_OPT( <NAME> ) - Option State
@findex STATE_OPT

If you need to know if an option was set because of presetting actions
(configuration file processing or environment variables), versus a command
line entry versus one of the SET/DISABLE macros, then use this macro.  It
will yield one of four values: @code{OPTST_INIT}, @code{OPTST_SET},
@code{OPTST_PRESET} or @code{OPTST_DEFINED}.  It is used thus:

@example
switch (STATE_OPT( NAME )) @{
    case OPTST_INIT:
        not-preset, set or on the command line.  (unless CLEAR-ed)

    case OPTST_SET:
        option set via the SET_OPT_NAME() macro.

    case OPTST_PRESET:
        option set via an configuration file or environment variable

    case OPTST_DEFINED:
        option set via a command line option.

@node USAGE
@subsection USAGE( exit-code ) - Usage invocation macro
@findex USAGE

This macro invokes the procedure registered to display
the usage text.  Normally, this will be @code{optionUsage} from the
AutoOpts library, but you may select another procedure by specifying
@code{usage = "proc_name"} program attribute.  This procedure must
take two arguments@:  first, a pointer to the option descriptor, and
second the exit code.  The macro supplies the option descriptor
automatically.  This routine is expected to call @code{exit(3)} with
the provided exit code.

The @code{optionUsage} routine also behaves differently depending
on the exit code.:

@table @code
@item EXIT_SUCCESS (the value zero)
It is assumed that full usage help has been requested.  Consequently, more
information is provided than when displaying usage and exiting with a
non-zero exit code.  Output will be sent to @file{stdout} and the program will
exit with a zero status code.

@item EX_USAGE (64)
The abbreviated usage will be printed to @file{stdout} and the program will
exit with a zero status code.  ``EX_USAGE'' may or may not be 64.  If your
system provides ``/usr/include/sysexits.h'' that has a different value,
then that value will be used.

@item any other value
The abbreviated usage will be printed to stderr and the program will
exit with the provided status code.
@end table

@node VALUE_OPT_name
@subsection VALUE_OPT_name - Option Flag Value
@findex VALUE_OPT_name

This is a #define for the flag character used to
specify an option on the command line.  If @code{value} was not
specified for the option, then it is a unique number associated
with the option.  @code{option value} refers to this value,
@code{option argument} refers to the (optional) argument to the
option.

@example
switch (WHICH_OPT_OTHER_OPT) @{
case VALUE_OPT_NAME:
    this-option-was-really-opt-name;
case VALUE_OPT_OTHER_OPT:
    this-option-was-really-other-opt;
@}
@end example

@node VERSION
@subsection VERSION - Version and Full Version
@findex VERSION

If the @code{version} attribute is defined for the program,
then a stringified version will be #defined as PROGRAM_VERSION and
PROGRAM_FULL_VERSION.  PROGRAM_FULL_VERSION is used for printing
the program version in response to the version option.  The version
option is automatically supplied in response to this attribute, too.

You may access PROGRAM_VERSION via @code{programOptions.pzFullVersion}.

@node WHICH_IDX_name
@subsection WHICH_IDX_name - Which Equivalenced Index
@findex WHICH_IDX_name

This macro gets emitted only for equivalenced-to options.  It is used to
obtain the index for the one of the several equivalence class members
set the equivalenced-to option.

@example
switch (WHICH_IDX_OTHER_OPT) @{
case INDEX_OPT_NAME:
    this-option-was-really-opt-name;
case INDEX_OPT_OTHER_OPT:
    this-option-was-really-other-opt;

@node teOptIndex
@subsection teOptIndex - Option Index and Enumeration
@findex teOptIndex

This enum defines the complete set of options, both
user specified and automatically provided.  This can be used,
for example, to distinguish which of the equivalenced options
was actually used.

@example
switch (pOptDesc->optActualIndex) @{
case INDEX_OPT_FIRST:
    stuff;
case INDEX_OPT_DIFFERENT:
    different-stuff;
default:
    unknown-things;
@}

@node OPTIONS_STRUCT_VERSION
@subsection OPTIONS_STRUCT_VERSION - active version

You will not actually need to reference this value, but you need to be
aware that it is there.  It is the first value in the option descriptor
that you pass to @code{optionProcess}.  It contains a magic number and
version information.  Normally, you should be able to work with a more
recent option library than the one you compiled with.  However, if the
library is changed incompatibly, then the library will detect the out of
date magic marker, explain the difficulty and exit.  You will then need
to rebuild and recompile your option definitions.  This has rarely been
necessary.

@node Multi-Threading
@section Multi-Threading

AutoOpts was designed to configure a program for running.  This generally
happens before much real work has been started.  Consequently, it is
expected to be run before multi-threaded applications have started multiple
threads.  However, this is not always the case. Some applications may
need to reset and reload their running configuration, and some may use
@code{SET_OPT_xxx()} macros during processing.  If you need to dynamically
change your option configuration in your multi-threaded application, it is
your responsibility to prevent all threads from accessing the option
configuration state, except the one altering the configuration.

The various accessor macros (@code{HAVE_OPT()}, etc.) do not modify state
and are safe to use in a multi-threaded application.  It is safe as long
as no other thread is concurrently modifying state, of course.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node option descriptor
@section Option Descriptor File
@cindex option descriptor

This is the module that is to be compiled and linked with your program.
It contains internal data and procedures subject to change.  Basically,
it contains a single global data structure containing all the
information provided in the option definitions, plus a number of static
strings and any callout procedures that are specified or required.  You
should never have need for looking at this, except, perhaps, to examine
the code generated for implementing the @code{flag-code} construct.

@node binary not installed
@subsection binary distro, AutoOpts not installed

If you will be distributing (or copying) your project to a system that
does not have AutoOpts installed, you will need to statically link the
AutoOpts library, ``libopts'' into your program.  Get the link information
with ``@code{static-libs}'' instead of ``@code{ldflags}'':

@example
`autoopts-config static-libs`
@end example

@node binary pre-installed
@subsection binary distro, AutoOpts pre-installed

If you will be distributing (or copying) your project to a system that does
have AutoOpts (or only ``libopts'') installed, you will still need to ensure
that the library is findable at program load time, or you will still have to
statically link.  The former can be accomplished by linking your project with
@code{--rpath} or by setting the @code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} appropriately.
Otherwise, @xref{binary not installed}.

@node source pre-installed
@subsection source distro, AutoOpts pre-installed

If you will be distributing your project to a system that will build
your product but it may not be pre-installed with AutoOpts, you will
need to do some configuration checking before you start the build.
Assuming you are willing to fail the build if AutoOpts has not been
installed, you will still need to do a little work.

AutoOpts is distributed with a configuration check M4 script,
@file{autoopts.m4}.  It will add an @code{autoconf} macro named,
@code{AG_PATH_AUTOOPTS}.  Add this to your @file{configure.ac} script
and use the following substitution values:

@table @code
@item AUTOGEN
the name of the autogen executable
@item AUTOGEN_TPLIB
the directory where AutoGen template library is stored
@item AUTOOPTS_CFLAGS
the compile time options needed to find the AutoOpts headers
@item AUTOOPTS_LIBS
the link options required to access the @code{libopts} library
@end table

@node source not installed
@subsection source distro, AutoOpts not installed

If you will be distributing your project to a system that will build
your product but it may not be pre-installed with AutoOpts, you may
wish to incorporate the sources for @code{libopts} in your project.
To do this, I recommend reading the tear-off libopts library
@file{README} that you can find in the @file{pkg/libopts} directory.
You can also examine an example package (blocksort) that incorporates
this tear off library in the autogen distribution directory.  There is
also a web page that describes what you need to do:
@example
@url{http://autogen.sourceforge.net/blocksort.html}
@end example

Alternatively, you can pull the @code{libopts} library sources into
a build directory and build it for installation along with your package.
This can be done approximately as follows:
@example
tar -xzvf `autoopts-config libsrc`
cd libopts-*
./bootstrap
configure
make
make install
@end example
That will install the library, but not the headers or anything else.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Presetting Options
@section Configuring your program
@cindex shell options

AutoOpts supports the notion of ``presetting'' the value or state of an option.
The values may be obtained either from environment variables or from
configuration files (@file{rc} or @file{ini} files).  In order to take
advantage of this, the AutoOpts client program must specify these features
in the option descriptor file (@pxref{program attributes}) with the
@code{rcfile} or @code{environrc} attributes.

* environrc::           environment variable presets
@end menu

It is also possible to configure your program @i{without} using
the command line option parsing code.  This is done by using
only the following four functions from the @file{libopts} library:

@table @samp
@item configFileLoad
(@pxref{libopts-configFileLoad}) will parse the contents of a config
file and return a pointer to a structure representing the hierarchical
value.  The values are sorted alphabetically by the value name and all
entries with the same name will retain their original order.
Insertion sort is used.

@item optionGetValue
(@pxref{libopts-optionGetValue}) will find the first value within the
hierarchy with a name that matches the name passed in.

@item optionNextValue
(@pxref{libopts-optionNextValue}) will return the next value that
follows the value passed in as an argument.  If you wish to get all
the values for a particular name, you must take note when the name
changes.

@item optionUnloadNested
(@pxref{libopts-optionUnloadNested}).  The pointer passed in must be
of type, @code{OPARG_TYPE_HIERARCHY} (see the autoopts/options.h
header file).  @code{configFileLoad} will return a @code{tOptionValue}
pointer of that type.  This function will release all the associated
memory.  @code{AutoOpts} generated code uses this function for its own
needs.  Client code should only call this function with pointers
gotten from @code{configFileLoad}.

@menu

@end menu

@node loading rcfile
@subsection configuration file presets
@cindex rcfile

Configuration files are enabled by specifying the program attribute
@code{homerc} (@pxref{program attributes}).  Any option not marked
with the ``no-preset'' attribute may appear in a configuration file.
The files loaded are selected both by the @code{homerc} entries and,
optionally, via a command line option.  The first component of the
@code{homerc} entry may be an environment variable such as @code{$HOME}, or
it may also be @code{$$} (@strong{two} dollar sign characters) to specify
the directory of the executable.  For example:

@example
homerc = "$$/../share/autogen";
@end example

@noindent
will cause the AutoOpts library to look in the normal autogen datadir
relative to the current installation directory for autogen.

The configuration files are processed in the order they are specified by
the @code{homerc} attribute, so that each new file will normally override
the settings of the previous files.  This may be overridden by marking some
options for @code{immediate action} (@pxref{Immediate Action}).  Any such
options are acted upon in @strong{reverse} order.  The disabled
@code{load-opts} (@code{--no-load-opts}) option, for example, is an
immediate action option.  Its presence in the last @code{homerc} file will
prevent the processing of any prior @code{homerc} files because its effect
is immediate.

Configuration file processing can be completely suppressed by specifying
@code{--no-load-opts} on the command line, or @code{PROGRAM_LOAD_OPTS=no} in
the environment (if @code{environrc} has been specified).

See the ``Configuration File Format'' section (@pxref{Config File Format})
for details on the format of the file.

@node saving rcfile
@subsection Saving the presets into a configuration file

When configuration files are enabled for an application, the user is
also provided with an automatically supplied @code{--save-opts} option.
All of the known option state will be written to either the specified
output file or, if it is not specified, then to the last specified
@code{homerc} file.

@node sample rcfile
@subsection Creating a sample configuration file
@cindex sample rcfile

AutoOpts is shipped with a template named, @file{rc-sample.tpl}.
If your option definition file specifies the @code{homerc} attribute,
then you may invoke @file{autogen} thus:

@example
autogen -Trc-sample <your-option-def-file>
@end example

This will, by default, produce a sample file named,
@file{sample-<prog-name>rc}.  It will be named differently if you specify your
configuration (rc) file name with the @code{rcfile} attribute.  In that case,
the output file will be named, @file{sample-<rcfile-name>}.  It will contain
all of the program options not marked as @code{no-preset}.  It will also
include the text from the @code{doc} attribute.

@node environrc
@subsection environment variable presets
@cindex environrc

If the AutoOpts client program specifies @code{environrc} in its
option descriptor file, then environment variables will be used for
presetting option state.  Variables will be looked for that are named,
@code{PROGRAM_OPTNAME} and @code{PROGRAM}.  @code{PROGRAM} is the
upper cased @code{C-name} of the program, and @code{OPTNAME} is the
upper cased @code{C-name} of a specific option.  (The @code{C-name}s
are the regular names with all special characters converted to
underscores (@code{_}).)

Option specific environment variables are processed after (and thus
take precedence over) the contents of the @code{PROGRAM} environment
variable.  The option argument string for these options takes on the
string value gotten from the environment.  Consequently, you can only
have one instance of the @code{OPTNAME}.

If a particular option may be disabled, then its disabled state is
indicated by setting the @code{PROGRAM_OPTNAME} value to the
disablement prefix.  So, for example, if the disablement prefix were
@code{dont}, then you can disable the @code{optname} option by setting
the @code{PROGRAM_OPTNAME}' environment variable to `@i{dont}'.
@xref{Common Attributes}.

The @code{PROGRAM} environment string is tokenized and parsed much
like a command line.  Doubly quoted strings have backslash escapes
processed the same way they are processed in C program constant
strings.  Singly quoted strings are ``pretty raw'' in that backslashes are
honored before other backslashes, apostrophes, newlines and cr/newline
pairs.  The options must be introduced with hyphens in the same way as
the command line.

Note that not all options may be preset.  Options that are specified with the
@code{no-preset} attribute and the @code{--help}, @code{--more-help},
and @code{--save-opts} auto-supported options may not be preset.

@node Config File Format
@section Configuration File Format
@cindex Configuration File

The configuration file is designed to associate names and values, much like
an AutoGen Definition File (@pxref{Definitions File}).  Unfortunately, the
file formats are different.  Specifically, AutoGen Definitions provide for
simpler methods for the precise control of a value string and provides for
dynamically computed content.  Configuration files have some established
traditions in their layout.  So, they are different, even though they do
both allow for a single name to be associated with multiple values and they
both allow for hierarchical values.

* config comments::             comments in the configuration file
@end menu

@node config name/string-value
@subsection assigning a string value to a configurable

The basic syntax is a name followed by a value on a single line.  They are
separated from each other by either white space, a colon (@code{:}) or an
equal sign (@code{=}).  The colon or equal sign may optionally be surrounded
by additional white space.  If more than one value line is needed, a
backslash (@code{\}) may be used to continue the value.  The backslash (but
not the newline) will be erased.  Leading and trailing white space is always
stripped from the value.

Fundamentally, it looks like this:

@example
name  value for that name
name = another \
     multi-line value \
     for that name.
name: a *third* value for ``name''
@end example

If you need more control over the content of the value, you may enclose the
value in XML style brackets:
@example
<name>value </name>
@end example
@noindent
Within these brackets you need not (must not) continue the value data with
backslashes.  You may also select the string formation rules to use, just
add the attribute after the name, thus: @code{<name keep>}.

@table @samp
@item keep
This mode will keep all text between the brackets and not strip any
white space.
@item uncooked
This mode strips leading and trailing white space, but not do any
quote processing.  This is the default and need not be specified.
@item cooked
Strings are formed and concatenated if, after stripping leading and trailing
white space, the text begins and ends with either single (') or double (")
quote characters.  That processing is identical to the string formation used
in AutoGen definition files (@pxref{basic expression}), except that backquotes
are treated like ordinary characters.
@end table

And here is an example of an XML-styled value:

@example
<name cooked>
    "This is\n\tanother multi-line\n"
    "\tstring example."
</name>
@end example

The string value associated with ``name'' will be exactly the text enclosed
in quotes with the escaped characters ``cooked'' as you would expect
(three text lines with the last line not ending with a newline, but
ending with a period).

@node config integer-values
@subsection integer values

A name can be specified as having an integer value.  To do this, you
must use the XML-ish format and specify a ``type'' attribute for
the name:

@example
<name type=integer> 1234 </name>
@end example

Boolean, enumeration and set membership types will be added as time
allows.  ``type=string'' is also supported, but also is the default.

@node config nested-values
@subsection hierarchical values

In order to specify a hierarchical value, you *must* use XML-styled
formatting, specifying a type that is shorter and easier to spell:

@example
<structured-name type=nested>
    [[....]]
</structured-name>
@end example

@noindent
The ellipsis may be filled with any legal configuration file name/value
assignments.

@node config sections
@subsection configuration file sections

Configuration files may be sectioned.
@cindex sectioned config file
If, for example, you have a collection of programs that work closely
together and, likely, have a common set of options, these programs may use a
single, sectioned, configuration file.  The file may be sectioned in either
of two ways.  The two ways may not be intermixed in a single configuration
file.  All text before the first segmentation line is processed, then only
the segment that applies:

@table @samp
@item [PROG_NAME]
The file is partitioned by lines that contains an square open bracket
(@code{[}), the @strong{upper-cased} c-variable-syntax program name
and a square close bracket (@code{]}).
For example, if the @command{prog-name} program had a sectioned
configuration file, then a line containing exactly @samp{[PROG_NAME]}
would be processed.

@item <?program prog-name>
The @code{<?} marker indicates an XML directive.
The @code{program} directive is interpreted by the configuration file
processor to segment the file in the same way as the @samp{[PROG_NAME]}
sectioning is done.  Any other XML directives are treated as comments.

@end table

@noindent
Segmentation does not apply if the config file is being parsed with
the @code{configFileLoad(3AutoOpts)} function.

@node config comments
@subsection comments in the configuration file

Comments are lines beginning with a hash mark (@code{#}),
XML-style comments (@code{<!-- arbitrary text -->}), and
unrecognized XML directives.

@example
# this is a comment
<!-- this is also
     a comment -->
<?this is
  a bad comment ;->
@end example

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node shell options
@section AutoOpts for Shell Scripts
@cindex shell options
@cindex configuration file

AutoOpts may be used with shell scripts either by automatically creating a
complete program that will process command line options and pass back
the results to the invoking shell by issuing shell variable assignment
commands, or it may be used to generate portable shell code that can
be inserted into your script.

The functionality of these features, of course, is somewhat constrained
compared with the normal program facilities.  Specifically, you cannot
invoke callout procedures with either of these methods.  Additionally,
if you generate a shell script to do the parsing:

@enumerate
@item
You cannot obtain options from configuration files.
@item
You cannot obtain options from environment variables.
@item
You cannot save the option state to an option file.
@item
Option conflict/requirement verification is disabled.
@end enumerate

Both of these methods are enabled by running AutoGen on
the definitions file with the additional main procedure attribute:

@example
main = @{ main-type = shell-process; @};
@end example
@noindent
or:
@example
main = @{ main-type = shell-parser; @};
@end example

If you do not supply a @code{proc-to-call}, it will default to
@code{optionPutShell}.  That will produce a program that will process the
options and generate shell text for the invoking shell to interpret
(@pxref{binary-parser}).  If you supply the name, @code{optionParseShell}, then
you will have a program that will generate a shell script that can parse the
options (@pxref{script-parser}).  If you supply a different procedure name,
you will have to provide that routine and it may do whatever you like.

@menu

* script-parser::        Parsing with a Portable Script
@end menu

@node binary-parser
@subsection Parsing with an Executable

The following commands are approximately all that is needed
to build a shell script command line option parser from
an option definition file:

@example
autogen -L <opt-template-dir> test-errors.def
cc -o test-errors -L <opt-lib-dir> -I <opt-include-dir> \
        -DTEST_PROGRAM_OPTS test-errors.c -lopts
@end example

The resulting program can then be used within your shell script as follows:

@example
eval `./test-errors "$@@"`
if [ -z "$@{OPTION_CT@}" ] ; then exit 1 ; fi
test $@{OPTION_CT@} -gt 0 && shift $@{OPTION_CT@}

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node AutoInfo
@section Automated Info Docs
@cindex AutoInfo

AutoOpts provides two templates for producing @file{.texi} documentation.
@file{aginfo.tpl} for the invoking section, and @file{aginfo3.tpl} for
describing exported library functions and macros.

For both types of documents, the documentation level is selected by
passing a @samp{-DLEVEL=<level-name>} argument to AutoGen when you build
the document.  (See the example invocation below.)

Two files will be produced, a @file{.texi} file and a @file{.menu} file.
You should include the @file{.menu} file in your document where you wish
to reference the @samp{invoking} chapter, section or subsection.

The @file{.texi} file will contain an introductory paragraph, a menu
and a subordinate section for the invocation usage and for each
documented option.  The introductory paragraph is normally the boiler
plate text, along the lines of:

@example
This chapter documents the @@file@{AutoOpts@} generated usage text
and option meanings for the @@file@{your-program@} program.
@end example

@noindent
or:

@example
These are the publicly exported procedures from the lib@i{name} library.
Any other functions mentioned in the @i{header} file are for the private use
of the library.
@end example

@menu
* command-info::      ``invoking'' info docs
* library-info::      library info docs
@end menu

@node command-info
@subsection ``invoking'' info docs

Using the option definitions for an AutoOpt client program, the
@file{aginfo.tpl} template will produce texinfo text that documents the
invocation of your program.  The text emitted is designed to be included
in the full texinfo document for your product.  It is not a stand-alone
document.  The usage text for the @ref{autogen usage},
@ref{getdefs usage} and @ref{columns usage} programs, are included in
this document and are all generated using this template.

If your program's option definitions include a
@samp{prog-info-descrip} section, then that text will replace the
boilerplate introductory paragraph.

@noindent
These files are produced by invoking the following command:

@example
autogen -L $@{prefix@}/share/autogen -T aginfo.tpl \
        -DLEVEL=section your-opts.def
@end example

@noindent
Where @file{$@{prefix@}} is the AutoGen installation prefix
and @file{your-opts.def} is the name of your product's option
definition file.

@node library-info
@subsection library info docs

The @file{texinfo} doc for libraries is derived from mostly the same
information as is used for producing man pages @xref{man3}.  The main
difference is that there is only one output file and the individual
functions are referenced from a @code{.texi} menu.  There is also
a small difference in the global attributes used:

@multitable @columnfractions .02 .23 .65
@item @tab lib_description
@tab A description of the library.  This text appears before the menu.
If not provided, the standard boilerplate version will be inserted.
@item
@item @tab see_also
@tab The @code{SEE ALSO} functionality is not supported for the
@file{texinfo} documentation, so any @code{see_also} attribute will be ignored.
@end multitable

@noindent
These files are produced by invoking the following commands:

@example
getdefs linenum srcfile template=aginfo3.tpl output=libexport.def \
       <source-file-list>

autogen -L $@{prefix@}/share/autogen -DLEVEL=section libexport.def
@end example

@noindent
Where @file{$@{prefix@}} is the AutoGen installation prefix
and @file{libexport.def} is some name that suits you.

An example of this can be seen in this document, @xref{libopts procedures}.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node AutoMan pages
@section Automated Man Pages
@cindex AutoMan pages

AutoOpts provides two templates for producing man pages.
The command (@file{man1}) pages are derived from the options definition
file, and the library (@file{man3}) pages are derived from
stylized comments (@pxref{getdefs Invocation}).

@menu
* man1::      command line man pages
* man3::      library man pages
@end menu

@node man1
@subsection command line man pages

Using the option definitions for an AutoOpts client program,
the @samp{agman1.tpl} template will produce an nroff document
suitable for use as a @samp{man(1)} page document for a command
line command.  The description section of the document is either
the @samp{prog-man-descrip} text, if present, or the @samp{detail}
text.

Each option in the option definitions file is fully documented
in its usage.  This includes all the information documented
above for each option (@pxref{option attributes}), plus
the @samp{doc} attribute is appended.  Since the @samp{doc}
text is presumed to be designed for @code{texinfo} documentation,
@code{sed} is used to convert some constructs from @code{texi}
to @code{nroff}-for-@code{man}-pages.  Specifically,

@example
convert @@code, @@var and @@samp into \fB...\fP phrases
convert @@file into \fI...\fP phrases
Remove the '@@' prefix from curly braces
Indent example regions
Delete the example commands
Replace @samp{end example} command with ".br"
Replace the @samp{@@*} command with ".br"
@end example

@noindent
This document is produced by invoking the following command:

@example
autogen -L $@{prefix@}/share/autogen -T agman1.tpl options.def
@end example

@noindent
Where @file{$@{prefix@}} is the AutoGen installation prefix and
@file{options.def} is the name of your product's option definition file.
I do not use this very much, so any feedback or improvements would be
greatly appreciated.

@node man3
@subsection library man pages

Two global definitions are required, and then
one library man page is produced for each @code{export_func} definition
that is found.  It is generally convenient to place these definitions
as @file{getdefs} comments (@pxref{getdefs Invocation}) near the procedure
definition, but they may also be a separate AutoGen definitions file
(@pxref{Definitions File}).  Each function will be cross referenced
with their sister functions in a @file{SEE ALSO} section.  A global
@code{see_also} definition will be appended to this cross referencing text.

@noindent
The two global definitions required are:

@multitable @columnfractions .02 .15 .77
@item @tab library
@tab This is the name of your library, without the @file{lib} prefix.
The AutoOpts library is named @file{libopts.so...}, so the @code{library}
attribute would have the value @code{opts}.
@item
@item @tab header
@tab Generally, using a library with a compiled program entails
@code{#include}-ing a header file.  Name that header with this attribute.
In the case of AutoOpts, it is generated and will vary based on the
name of the option definition file.  Consequently, @file{your-opts.h} is
specified.
@end multitable

@noindent
The @code{export_func} definition should contain the following attributes:

@multitable @columnfractions .02 .15 .77
@item @tab name
@tab The name of the procedure the library user may call.
@item @tab what
@tab A brief sentence describing what the procedure does.
@item @tab doc
@tab A detailed description of what the procedure does.
It may ramble on for as long as necessary to properly describe it.
@item @tab err
@tab A short description of how errors are handled.
@item @tab ret_type
@tab The data type returned by the procedure.
Omit this for @code{void} procedures.
@item @tab ret_desc
@tab Describe what the returned value is, if needed.
@item @tab private
@tab If specified, the function will @strong{not} be documented.
This is used, for example, to produce external declarations for functions
that are not available for public use, but are used in the generated text.
@item
@item @tab arg
@tab This is a compound attribute that contains:
@end multitable
@multitable @columnfractions .02 .15 .15 .62
@item @tab @tab arg_type
@tab The data type of the argument.
@item @tab @tab arg_name
@tab A short name for it.
@item @tab @tab arg_desc
@tab A brief description.
@end multitable

@noindent
As a @file{getdefs} comment, this would appear something like this:

@example
/*=--subblock=arg=arg_type,arg_name,arg_desc =*/
/*=*
 * library: opts
 * header:  your-opts.h
=*/
/*=export_func optionProcess
 *
 * what: this is the main option processing routine
 * arg:  + tOptions* + pOpts + program options descriptor +
 * arg:  + int       + argc  + program arg count  +
 * arg:  + char**    + argv  + program arg vector +
 * ret_type:  int
 * ret_desc:  the count of the arguments processed
 *
 * doc:  This is what it does.
 * err:  When it can't, it does this.
=*/
@end example

@noindent
Note the @code{subblock} and @code{library} comments.
@code{subblock} is an embedded @file{getdefs}
option (@pxref{getdefs subblock}) that tells it how to parse the
@code{arg} attribute.  The @code{library} and @code{header} entries
are global definitions that apply to all the documented functions.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node getopt_long
@section Using getopt(3C)
@cindex getopt_long

There is a template named, ``@code{getopt.tpl}'' that is distributed with
AutoOpts.  With it, you will have another source file generated for you that
will utilize either the standard @code{getopt(3C)} or the GNU
@code{getopt_long(3GNU)} function for parsing the command line arguments.
Which is used is selected by the presence or absence of the @code{long-opts}
program attribute.  It will save you from being dependent upon the
@code{libopts} library @i{and} it produces code ready for
internationalization.  However, it also carries with it some limitations on
the use of AutoOpts features:

@enumerate
@item
You cannot automatically take advantage of environment variable options or
rc (ini) files.

@item
You cannot use set membership, enumerated, range checked or stacked
argument type options.  In fact, you cannot use anything that depends
upon the @code{libopts} library.  You are constrained to options that
take ``@code{string}'' arguments, though you may handle the option
argument with a callback procedure.

@item
You must specify every option as ``settable'' because the emitted code
depends upon the @code{SET_OPT_XXX} macros having been defined.

@item
You must specify a main procedure of type ``main''.  The
@file{getopt.tpl} template depends upon being able to compile the
traditional .c file into a program and get it to emit the usage text.

@item
For the same reason, the traditional option parsing table code must be
emitted @b{before} the @file{getopt.tpl} template gets expanded.

@item
The usage text is, therefore, statically defined.

@item
You must supply some compile and link options via environment variables.
@table @samp
@item srcdir
In case the option definition file lives in a different directory.
@item CFLAGS
Any special flags required to compile.  This should minimally include
the output from running the @code{autoopts-config cflags} script.
@item LDFLAGS
Any special flags required to link.  This should minimally include
the output from running the @code{autoopts-config ldflags} script.
@item CC
Set this only if ``@code{cc}'' cannot be found in @code{$PATH}
(or it is not the one you want).
@end table
@end enumerate

@noindent
To use this, set the exported environment variables and then invoke
autogen twice, in the following order:

@example
autogen myprog-opts.def
autogen -T getopt.tpl myprog-opts.def
@end example

@noindent
and you will have three new files: @file{myprog-opts.h}, @file{myprog-opts.c},
and @file{getopt-progname.c}, where ``progname'' is the name specified with
the global @code{prog-name} attribute in the option definition file.  You must
compile and link both @file{.c} files into your program.  If there are link
failures, then you are using AutoOpts features that require the @file{libopts}
library.  You must remove these features.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node i18n
@section Internationalizing AutoOpts
@cindex Internationalizing AutoOpts

The generated code for AutoOpts will enable and disable the translation of
AutoOpts run time messages.  If @code{ENABLE_NLS} is defined at compile time,
then the @code{_()} macro may be used to specify a translation function.  If
undefined, it will default to @code{gettext(3GNU)}.  This define will also
enable a callback function that @code{optionProcess} invokes at the
beginning of option processing.  The AutoOpts @code{libopts} library will
always check for this ``compiled with NLS'' flag, so @code{libopts} does not
need to be specially compiled.  The strings returned by the translation
function will be @code{strdup(3)-ed} and kept.  They will not be
re-translated, even if the locale changes, but they will also not be dependent
upon reused or unmappable memory.

To internationalize option processing, you should first internationalize your
program.  Then, the option processing strings can be added to your translation
text by processing the AutoOpts-generated @file{my-opts.c} file and adding the
distributed @file{po/usage-txt.pot} file.  (Also by extracting the strings
yourself from the @file{usage-txt.h} file.)  When you call
@code{optionProcess}, all of the user visible AutoOpts strings will be passed
through the localization procedure established with the @code{_()}
preprocessing macro.

@c === SECTION MARKER

@node Naming Conflicts
@section Naming Conflicts
@cindex Naming Conflicts

AutoOpts generates a header file that contains many C preprocessing macros and
several external names.  For the most part, they begin with either @code{opt_}
or @code{option}, or else they end with @code{_opt}.  If this happens to
conflict with other macros you are using, or if you are compiling multiple
option sets in the same compilation unit, the conflicts can be avoided.  You
may specify an external name @code{prefix} (@pxref{program attributes}) for
all of the names generated for each set of option definitions.

Among these macros, several take an option name as a macro argument.
Sometimes, this will inconveniently conflict.  For example, if you specify an
option named, @code{debug}, the emitted code will presume that @code{DEBUG} is
not a preprocessing name.  Or also, if you are building on a Windows platform,
you may find that MicroSoft has usurped a number of user space names in its
header files.  Consequently, you will get a preprocessing error if you use,
for example, @code{HAVE_OPT(DEBUG)} or @code{HAVE_OPT(INTERNAL)}
(@pxref{HAVE_OPT}) in your code.  You may trigger an obvious warning for such
conflicts by specifying the @code{guard-option-names} attribute
(@pxref{program attributes}).  That emitted code will also @code{#undef}-ine
the conflicting name.
