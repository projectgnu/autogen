  for "option_name"
* Set membership strings are now more forgiving in their syntax.

New in 5.17.2 February 2013

* AutoOpts translatability improvements.  The translatable strings
  are now inserted into a dummy procedure in the option processing
  code file.  These can be extracted by xgettext, translated and
  then displayed when the libopts library encounters any processing
  issues.  Also, if the client code provides the full usage text
  string, it will be broken up into "paragraphs" that are easier
  for the translators to do their jobs.

* i18n updates -- the translatable strings were not very.
  The stuff was reworked so that usage text can be constructed
  in English, specified as the full usage text and then
  readily translated a paragraph at a time.

* larger blocks of help text are now broken down into paragraphs
  when NLS support has been specified.  These paragraphs are also
  emitted into an xgettext extractable form so translators have
  matching text to work from.

* Autogen tries to catch most signals.  This is done so that it can
  emit appropriate messages before dying.  However, "SIGPROF" is
  often signaled extremely early, before initialization is complete.
  Cleanup is no longer performed before initialzation is complete.
  "SIGPROF" is exempted from capture.

New in 5.17.1 January, 2013

* Added a documentation substitution stanza so that texi, man
  and mdoc documents may be massaged before being finalized.

* Section 5 man pages and mdoc pages can now be emitted
  with the templates.  They still need work, though.
